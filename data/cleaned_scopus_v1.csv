Too little attention has been paid to tax default prediction in the past. Moreover, existing approaches tend to apply conventional statistical methods rather than advanced data analytic approaches, including state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Therefore, existing studies cannot effectively detect tax default information in real-world financial data because they fail to take into account the appropriate data transformations and nonlinear relationships between early-warning financial indicators and tax default behavior. To overcome these problems, this study applies diverse feature transformation techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. The proposed prediction system is validated by using a dataset showing tax defaults and non-defaults at Finnish limited liability firms. Our findings provide evidence for a major role of feature transformation, such as logarithmic and square-root transformation, in improving the performance of tax default prediction. We also show that extreme gradient boosting and the systematically developed forest of multiple decision trees outperform other machine learning methods in terms of accuracy and other classification performance measures. We show that the equity ratio, liquidity ratio, and debt-to-sales ratio are the most important indicators of tax defaults for 1-year-ahead predictions. Therefore, this study highlights the essential role of well-designed tax default prediction systems, which require a combination of feature transformation and machine learning methods. The effective implementation of an automatic tax default prediction system has important implications for tax administration and can assist administrators in achieving feasible government expenditure allocations and revenue expansions. © 2013 IEEE.",corporate tax; Default prediction; feature transformation; machine learning,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mathematical transformations; Predictive analytics; Taxation; Classification performance; Feature transformations; Financial indicator; Government expenditure; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Non-linear relationships; State-of-the-art machine learning methods; Economic analysis,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099111620

Analyzing the trends in revenue being collected from Customs is necessary to direct government policies and decisions. Models that can capture the trends being purported from the nominal (nonreal) tax values with respect to the trade volumes (value) over the period are indispensable. Predominant amongst the existing models are the econometric models (the GDP-based model, the monthly receipts model, and the microsimulation model), which are laborious and sometimes unreliable when studying trends in time series data. In this study, we modelled monthly revenue data obtained from the Ghana Revenue Authority-Customs Division (GRA-CD) for the period January 2010 to December 2019 using two traditional time series models, ARIMA model and ARIMA Error Regression Model (ARIMAX), and two machine learning time series models, Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model and a Neural Network Autoregression model. The Neural Network Autoregression model of the form NNAR (1, 3) provided the best forecasts with the least Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 53.87 and relatively lower Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.08. Generally, the machine learning models (NNAR (1, 3) and BSTS) outperformed the traditional time series models (ARIMA and ARIMAX models). The forecast values from the NNAR (1, 3) indicated a potential decline in revenue and this emphasizes the need for relevant authorities to institute measures to improve revenue generation in the immediate future.  © 2022 Diana Ayorkor Agbenyega et al.",,,,Hindawi Limited,16879724,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129685583

One source of regional income is a local tax, based on law no 28 of 2009, one type of tax-managed by local government is the parking tax. Either an off-street parking lots, those provided in connection with the business principal, those provided as a business, or motor vehicle daycare (Indonesian Law No.28 of 2009). The parking tax is a self-assessment tax. Taxpayers will calculate their amount of tax that must be paid to the government. Therefore, the local government should conduct oversight of the reports of taxpayers. One form of supervision carried out is to monitor the number of vehicles at the taxpayer's location. Officers then record the number of vehicles based on vehicle classification, whether they were two-wheeled or four-wheeled vehicles or other vehicle types. Currently, monitoring is done manually using a mechanical counter. This monitoring may have the risk of being miscalculated or wrongly recorded due to the monitoring officer's oversight. Computer vision (OpenCV library) and machine learning (Mask R-CNN), is expected to minimize these errors and optimize the officers' performance on duty. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Machine learning; Vehicles; Four-wheeled vehicles; Local government; Monitoring system; Motor vehicle; Number of vehicles; Self assessment; Vehicle classification; Vehicle types; Taxation,Sari M.W.,IOP Publishing Ltd,17426588,,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103860633

The estimates regarding tax fraud at the international level reveals that Nigeria is one of the developing countries with a high level of tax fraud. The negative effect of this on the nation is quite evident as Nigeria as a nation had in the past depended majorly on oil giving less concern on tax as a source of revenue generation but lately, the oil sector is not booming as previous, which calls for urgent reinstatement of the tax sector which is one of her enormous sources of revenue generation. This research focuses on the detection of fraudulent activities in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Nigeria using an intelligent data mining system. The intelligent system directly accesses the database of the SMEs tax payers and flows whistle whenever a fraudulent activity is suspected.

Carucci, 99, Rome, 00193, Italy","The revenue loss from tax avoidance can undermine the effectiveness and equity of the government policies. A standard measure of its magnitude is known as the tax gap, that is defined as the difference between the total taxes theoretically collectable and the total taxes actually collected in a given period. Estimation from a micro perspective is usually tackled in the context of bottom-up approaches, where data regularly collected through fiscal audits are analyzed in order to provide inference on the general population. However, the sampling scheme of fiscal audits performed by revenue agencies is not random but characterized by a selection bias toward risky taxpayers. The current standard adopted by the Italian Revenue Agency (IRA) for overcoming this issue in the Tax audit context is the Heckman model, based on linear models for modeling both the selection and the outcome mechanisms. Here we propose the adoption of the CART-based Gradient Boosting in place of standard linear models to account for the complex patterns often arising in the relationships between covariates and outcome. Selection bias is corrected by considering a re-weighting scheme based on propensity scores, attained through the sequential application of a classifier and a regressor. In short we refer to the method as 2-step Gradient Boosting. We argue how this scheme fits the sampling mechanism of the IRA fiscal audits, and it is applied to a sample of VAT declarations from Italian individual firms in the fiscal year 2011. Results show a marked dominance of the proposed method over the currently adopted Heckman model in terms of predictive performances. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Gradient Boosting; Machine learning; Selection bias; Tax gap,,,Institute for Ionics,16182510,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131439116

It is defined as the intentional alteration of information provided on a tax return to reduce someone's tax liability. This is done by either reducing sales or increasing purchases. According to recent studies, governments lose over $500 billion annually due to tax fraud. A loss of this magnitude motivates tax authorities worldwide to implement efficient fraud detection strategies. Most of the work done in tax fraud using machine learning is centered on supervised models. A significant drawback of this approach is that it requires tax returns that have been previously audited, which constitutes a small percentage of the data. Other strategies focus on using unsupervised models that utilize the whole data when they search for patterns, though ignore whether the tax returns are fraudulent or not. Therefore, unsupervised models are limited in their usefulness if they are used independently to detect tax fraud. The work done in this paper focuses on addressing such limitations by proposing a fraud detection framework that utilizes supervised and unsupervised models to exploit the entire set of tax returns. The framework consists of four modules: A supervised module, which utilizes a tree-based model to extract knowledge from the data; an unsupervised module, which calculates anomaly scores; a behavioral module, which assigns a compliance score for each taxpayer; and a prediction module, which utilizes the output of the previous modules to output a probability of fraud for each tax return. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by testing it on existent tax returns provided by the Saudi tax authority. © 2023 Authors.

Underreporting, which entails filing a tax return with a lower tax base by either raising purchases or lowering sales, is one of the most widespread types of tax fraud. Such an action weakens government spending by reducing government revenues. Since there are not enough resources or auditors to handle the situation, tax authorities must come up with low-cost solutions. Therefore, one of their top priorities should be identifying tax fraud. The vast bulk of research on tax fraud detection is based on supervised machine learning techniques that make use of the findings of tax return audits. Unfortunately, access to audited and labeled tax returns is quite restricted because it is an expensive and time-consuming process. This places severe restrictions on supervised machine learning techniques. The work in this paper focuses on finding solutions to these constraints. We specifically outline our method for finding anomalies in tax returns using stacked autoencoders (SAEs), along with a probability distribution of the suspicious values for each field on the tax return form. By comparing the outcomes of our method with two existing anomaly techniques that have been utilized in the literature, we show how well our model can identify current tax fraud schemes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,Crime; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Probability distributions; Supervised learning; Auto encoders; Features selection; Fraud detection; Government spending; Machine learning techniques; Supervised machine learning; Tax authorities; Tax basis; Tax returns; Value-added tax; Taxation,Khanna A.; Polkowski Z.; Castillo O.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,978-981197614-8,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152584005

A soda tax is an excise tax charged on selling SSBs to reduce consumption. Currently, 8 cities/counties in the United States have imposed soda taxes. Objective: This study assessed people's sentiments toward soda taxes in the United States based on social media posts on Twitter. Design: We designed a search algorithm to systematically identify and collect soda tax-related tweets posted on Twitter. We built deep neural network models to classify tweets by sentiments. Setting: Computer modeling. Participants: Approximately 370 000 soda tax-related tweets posted on Twitter from January 1, 2015, to April 16, 2022. Main Outcome Measure: Sentiment associated with a tweet. Results: Public attention paid to soda taxes, indicated by the number of tweets posted annually, peaked in 2016, but has declined considerably ever since. The decreasing prevalence of tweets quoting soda tax-related news without revealing sentiments coincided with the rapid increase in tweets expressing a neutral sentiment toward soda taxes. The prevalence of tweets expressing a negative sentiment rose steadily from 2015 to 2019 and then slightly leveled off, whereas that of tweets expressing a positive sentiment remained unchanged. Excluding news-quoting tweets, tweets with neutral, negative, and positive sentiments occupied roughly 56%, 29%, and 15%, respectively, during 2015-2022. The authors' total number of tweets posted, followers, and retweets predicted tweet sentiment. The finalized neural network model achieved an accuracy of 88% and an F1 score of 0.87 in predicting tweet sentiments in the test set. Conclusions: Despite its potential to shape public opinion and catalyze social changes, social media remains an underutilized source of information to inform government decision making. Social media sentiment analysis may inform the design, implementation, and modification of soda tax policies to gain social support while minimizing confusion and misinterpretation. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The core of the problem is that the standing general theories cannot even explain why people comply as much as they do, much less make predictions or support prescriptions for the public entities. The compliance decision is a challenge posed to rational choice theory, and one that defies the current choice mechanisms in multi-agent systems. The key idea of this project is that by considering rationally-heterogeneous agents immersed in a highly social environment we can get hold of a better grasp of what is really involved in the individual decisions. Moreover, we aim at understanding how those decisions determine tendencies for the behaviour of the whole society, and how in turn those tendencies influence individual behaviour. This paper presents the results of some exploratory simulations carried out to uncover regularities, correlations and trends in the models that represent first and then expand the standard theories on the field. We conclude that forces like social imitation and local neighbourhood enforcement and reputation are far more important than individual perception of expected utility maximising, in what respects compliance decisions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation; Decision making; Regulatory compliance; Taxation; Exploratory simulations; Tax compliance decisions; Multi agent systems,,Springer Verlag,3029743,978-354076536-3,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-37249080362

This program intends to fully subsidize property tax increases for eligible residents of neighborhoods where there are two major urban renewal projects underway, a stadium and a multi-use trail. We first estimate household-level income eligibility for the program with data science and machine learning approaches applied to publicly available household-level data. We then forecast future property appreciation due to urban renewal projects using random forests with historic tax assessment data. Combining these projections with household-level eligibility, we estimate the costs of the program for different eligibility scenarios. We find that our household-level data and machine learning techniques result in fewer eligible homeowners but significantly larger program costs, due to higher property appreciation rates than the original analysis, which was based on census and city-level data. Our methods have limitations, namely incomplete data sets, the accuracy of representative income samples, the availability of characteristic training set data for the property tax appreciation model, and challenges in validating the model results. The eligibility estimates and property appreciation forecasts we generated were also incorporated into an interactive tool for residents to determine program eligibility and view their expected increases in home values. Community residents have been involved with this work and provided greater transparency, accountability, and impact of the proposed program. Data collected from residents can also correct and update the information, which would increase the accuracy of the program estimates and validate the modeling, leading to a novel application of community-driven data science. © The Author(s) 2018.",crowdsourcing; data science; income estimation; property tax; Urban renewal,Atlanta; Georgia; United States; household income; machine learning; policy analysis; tax reform; urban renewal,,SAGE Publications Ltd,23998083,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059468115

Having to deal with broadly defined fraud and heterogeneous taxpayers, as well as a relatively small sample, we successfully derive important features from tax returns with a minimum of additional information. Among the important fraud predictors, we obtain historical fraud and audit, share of administrative costs, and external economic activity. We see two main contributions with generalizable practical implications for auditing authorities. First, by focusing on the lift score of the top decile, we demonstrate that even moderately accurate models can improve upon existing accuracy of rule-based approaches. Second, and more importantly, we demonstrate that the information contained in the supplier and buyer network of the taxpayer can be used whenever important predictors of fraud such as historical audits and fraud are not available. This is particularly important for situations with newly established companies, who would otherwise be under-rated in terms of fraud probability. © 2022 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic review technique with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method, this study evaluates 62 papers collected from the Scopus database. The papers were analyzed through textometry of titles, abstracts and keywords to identify prevailing trends and insights. Findings: The review reveals that digitalization, particularly through AI and blockchain, significantly enhances tax compliance and operational efficiency. However, challenges persist, especially in emerging economies, regarding the adoption and integration of these technologies in tax systems. The findings indicate a global trend toward digital Tax Administration 3.0, emphasizing the importance of regulatory frameworks, capacity building and simplification for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Practical implications: The findings provide guidance for policymakers and tax administrations, underscoring the necessity of strategic planning, regulatory backing and global cooperation to effectively use digital technologies in tax compliance. Emphasizing the need for tailored support for SMEs, the study also calls for expanded research in less represented areas and specific sectors, such as SMEs and developing economies, to deepen global insights into digital tax compliance.

We argue that upper-layer governments anticipate the impact of local income sorting and strategically adjust their statutory tax schedules. The mobility of the income tax base sets limits to such strategic behavior.

Altogether 12 variations of billing messages (social norms, simplification, disclosure, previous engagement, reminders and previous choices) were evaluated, and their effectiveness was tested. The messages were transmitted to defaulting microentrepreneurs in four Brazilian states. From a database containing information about defaulting micro entrepreneurs, 250 thousand text messages were sent making charges. The data were obtained from the Secretaria Especial da Micro e Pequena Empresa (Sempe). Tests were used to analyse the difference between means and Logistic Regression was used in sequence. The Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes widgets were used to indicate the robustness of the Machine Learning predictive model. The research findings indicated that the formats “simplification”, “previous choices” and “alert”, employees, did not have an effect in combating default. However, when aligned with social norms, messages in the form of “past options” and “re-minders” increase the payment of debts. The widgets used indicated an excellent fit to the machine learning model. The Random Forest tool attested with superiority that the model is robust and suitable for the predictive function. The results of the research provide a contribution to public policies when they present an effective action to reduce defaults in the payment of taxes. The use of messages in the social norm format can be adapted to other situations, constituting a suggestion for future research. © 2024, Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C..

The risk management system aims to detect risk-fraught cases in order to prevent tax evasion. Cases identified as risk-fraught by the system need to be checked manually by the responsible tax official. Although the technical details of risk management systems are kept secret, such systems are presumably based on artificial intelligence.

While the field of algorithmic fairness has developed primarily around notions of treating like individuals alike, we instead explore the concept of vertical equity - appropriately accounting for relevant differences across individuals - which is a central component of fairness in many public policy settings. Applied to the design of the U.S. individual income tax system, vertical equity relates to the fair allocation of tax and enforcement burdens across taxpayers of different income levels. Through a unique collaboration with the Treasury Department and IRS, we use access to detailed, anonymized individual taxpayer microdata, risk-selected audits, and random audits from 2010-14 to study vertical equity in tax administration. In particular, we assess how the adoption of modern machine learning methods for selecting taxpayer audits may affect vertical equity. Our paper makes four contributions. First, we show how the adoption of more flexible machine learning (classification) methods - as opposed to simpler models - shapes vertical equity by shifting audit burdens from high to middle-income taxpayers. Second, given concerns about high audit rates of low-income taxpayers, we investigate how existing algorithmic fairness techniques would change the audit distribution. We find that such methods can mitigate some disparities across income buckets, but that these come at a steep cost to performance. Third, we show that the choice of whether to treat risk of underreporting as a classification or regression problem is highly consequential. Moving from a classification approach to a regression approach to predict the expected magnitude of underreporting shifts the audit burden substantially toward high income individuals, while increasing revenue. Last, we investigate the role of differential audit cost in shaping the distribution of audits. Audits of lower income taxpayers, for instance, are typically conducted by mail and hence pose much lower cost to the IRS. We show that a narrow focus on return-on-investment can undermine vertical equity. Our results have implications for ongoing policy debates and the design of algorithmic tools across the public sector. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,Economics; Machine learning; Algorithmics; Audit models; Central component; Fair allocation; Income levels; Income tax; Internal revenue services; Low incomes; Policy setting; Tax systems; Taxation,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145039352-2,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132974348

For this reason, this type of location decision is usually targeted by anti-avoidance laws, that can take the form either of specific rules or general standards that, ex-post, sanction or limit the location decision. However, rules entail higher drafting costs and are easy to circumvent whereas standards entail more uncertainty costs. The goal of this paper is to illustrate that the risk of aggressive location decisions can be predicted ex-ante using publicly available data and that this prediction can be used by tax authorities. In the paper, we do two things. First, we use publicly available accounting data for the period 2015–2019 on 4031 group ultimate owners (GUO) of active listed companies resident in one of the 27 European Union countries to predict the probability that these companies would have at least a subsidiary in a tax haven, by spring 2021, as well as the intensity in the use of tax havens. Second, we discuss how this prediction can be used by tax authorities in the context of a new administrative preventive approach that complements the traditional legal approach.

Drawing on nationally representative surveys, we predict individual tax opposition across 28 countries in 2010 and 2020 (N = 70 710). Personal values and environmental evaluations tend to be more influential than demographics in predicting tax opposition, with key variables differing between countries and over time. A lack of commitment to pro-environmental behavior is the most important predictor in emerging economies. Conversely, concerns about environmental issues and prioritization of jobs and prices are influential in high-income countries, gaining prominence over the previous decade.

The state of Illinois has used traditional techniques of economic and tax receipt forecasting in order to project the amount of resources that it will have in order to finance its activities and debts. Such techniques are mostly linear and lack the ability to model more complex non-linear or long term dependencies. Recently, deep learning models have shown promising results in time series forecasting. In this study, we use two types of neural networks (a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron and a Long Short Term Memory network to forecast the state of Illinois sale tax receipts and compare the performance of both models against the more traditional autoregressive integrated moving Average model. Unfortunately, only limited tax receipt data is publicly made available by the state of Illinois which makes it particularly challenging to train a robust neural network model without overfitting. To address this data limitation, we propose to use a global model with an embedding layer for all ten tax categories. The empirical results show that the global Multi-Layer Perceptron model has the best performance in one step forecasting of Illinois sale tax receipts followed by the global Long Short Term memory model.

Effective tax evasion detection is critical for assisting tax authorities in mitigating tax revenue loss. Recently, machine-learning-based methods, particularly those employing positive and unlabeled (PU) learning, have been adopted for tax evasion detection, achieving notable success. However, these methods exhibit two major practical limitations. First, their success heavily relies on the strong assumption that the label frequency (the fraction of identified taxpayers among tax evaders) is known in advance. Second, although some methods attempt to estimate label frequency using approaches like Mixture Proportion Estimation (MPE) without making any assumptions, they subsequently construct a classifier based on the error-prone label frequency obtained from the previous estimation. This two-stage approach may not be optimal, as it neglects error accumulation in classifier training resulting from the estimation bias in the first stage. To address these limitations, we propose a novel PU learning-based tax evasion detection framework called RR-PU, which can revise the bias in a two-stage synergistic manner. Specifically, RR-PU refines the label frequency initialization by leveraging a regrouping technique to fortify the MPE perspective. Subsequently, we integrate a trainable slack variable to fine-tune the initial label frequency, concurrently optimizing this variable and the classifier to eliminate latent bias in the initial stage. Experimental results on three real-world tax datasets demonstrate that RR-PU outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tax evasion detection tasks.

Consequently, understanding the factors that shape tax avoidance is critically important. Exploiting a cutting-edge measure of corporate integrity derived from state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and textual analysis, we explore the effect of corporate integrity on tax avoidance. Our text-based measure is based on a textual analysis of earnings conference call transcripts. Our findings show that companies with greater corporate integrity are significantly less involved in tax avoidance. Further analysis corroborates the results, i.e., propensity score matching, entropy balancing, and an instrumental variable analysis. Our findings are especially noteworthy as they demonstrate that corporate culture, although intangible in nature, exerts a substantial influence on corporate behavior. © 2024 Chatjuthamard et al.

They have to select the appropriate orders according to their capacity limitations and profit consideration, and then complete these orders by their due dates or no later than their deadlines. OAS problems have attracted significant attention in supply chain management. However, there is an issue that has not been studied well. To our best knowledge, no prior research examines the carbon emission cost and the time-of-use electricity cost in the OAS problems. The carbon emission during the on-peak hours is lower than the one in mid-peak and off-peak hours. However, the electricity cost during the on-peak hours is higher than the one during mid-peak and off-peak hours when time-of-use electricity (TOU) tariff is used. There is a trade-off between sustainable scheduling and the electricity cost. To calculate the objective value, a carbon tax and carbon dioxide emission factor are included when we evaluate the carbon emission cost. The objective function is to maximize the total revenue of the accepted orders and then subtract the carbon emission cost and the electricity cost under different time intervals on a single machine with sequence-dependent setup times and release date. This research proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) and a relaxation method of MILP model to solve this problem. It is of importance because the OAS problems are practical in industry.

It occurs when traders intentionally mis-classify goods during the time of clearance. Classification fraud results in tax revenue loss, restricted and prohibited goods entry, and unfair market competition. Current manual verification techniques to detect classification fraud are time-consuming and error-prone; thus, an effective and precise strategy is required. In this study, we developed and evaluated the performance of Logistic Regression and LightGBM machine learning models in detecting HS Code fraud using a dataset obtained from a government Revenue Authority in a developing country. Results show that the LightGBM model outperformed Logistic Regression. The LightGBM model demonstrated superior accuracy (0.961), precision (0.890), recall (0.901), and F1 score (0.896) as compared to the Logistic Regression model, which had accuracy (0.932), precision (0.772), recall (0.900), and F1 score (0.831). Our contribution is threefold: Firstly, the dataset used is from a developing country, unlike other studies that use datasets from developed countries. Secondly, we worked with Customs import data collected at an 8-digit HS code level, whereas most similar studies typically used HS codes at 2, 4, or 6-digit levels. Lastly, unlike comparable studies, we have compared the performance of Logistic Regression and LightGBM machine learning algorithms.  © 2024 IEEE.",custom tariff classification fraud; harmonised system; machine learning,Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Crime; Machine learning; Taxation; 'current; Custom tariff classification fraud; F1 scores; Harmonized system; Logistics regressions; Machine-learning; Market competition; Performance; System codes; Tax revenue; Logistic regression,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,979-833151740-3,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85215086615

But few studies have considered how agencies actually do interpret statutes, and none has empirically compared the methodologies of agencies and courts in prac-tice. This Article conducts such a comparison, using a newly created dataset of all Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publications ever released, along with an existing dataset of court decisions. It applies natural language processing, machine learning, and regression analysis to map methodological trends and to test whether particular authorities have developed unique cultures of statutory interpretation. It finds that, over time, the IRS has increasingly made rules on normative policy grounds (like fairness and efficiency) rather than merely producing rules based on the “best reading” of the relevant statute (under any interpretive theory, like purposivism or textualism). Moreover, when the IRS does focus on the statute, it has grown much more purposivist over time. In contrast, the Tax Court has not grown more normative and has followed the same trend toward textualism as most other courts. But although the Tax Court has become more broadly textualist, it prioritizes different interpretive tools than other courts, like Chevron deference and holistic-textual canons of interpretation. This suggests that each authority adopts its own flavor of textualism or purposivism. These findings complicate the literature on tax exceptionalism and the judicial nature of the Tax Court. They also inform ongoing debates about judicial deference and the future of doctrines like Chevron and Skidmore deference. Most broadly, they provide an empirical counterpoint to the existing theoretical literature on statutory interpretation by agencies. © 2020, New York University Law Review.

This work presents a machine learning-based method based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population data to forecast income tax collection. As a result, the violin plot shows the distribution of the data, namely that population values are concentrated around the middle, while GDP has a bimodal distribution, and income tax exhibits a pattern similar to that of the population. On both training and test data, several machine learning models were assessed for accuracy and generalization using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). With Train MAPE at 2.85% and Test MAPE at 5.53%, Random Forest attained a Train MSE of 25.94 and a Test MSE of 51.00, so indicating good performance but modest overfitting. Although Gradient Boosting had a higher Test MAPE of 6.89% suggesting some overfitting, it scored almost perfect Train MSE of 0.04.

The price fluctuation indirectly increases the ICMS tax - Tax on Operations related to the Circulation of Goods and on the Provision of Interstate and Intercity Transport and Communication Services - which is a tax revenues from states, considered their main source of revenues. If on one side, it benefits states, on the other, it negatively impacts the taxpayers and undermines some services, thus becoming a reverse problem, in which products and services are no longer sold or are replaced by lower-value products and consequently diminishing the state's revenues. Therefore, the fluctuations in fuel final prices impact several production chains that directly influence the state's revenues. Allied to this theme, there are frequent discussions about the change in the Brazilian taxation policy, which directly impacts the states' revenues. However, little is discussed about the direct and indirect revenue projections caused by potential tax changes. In this context, this study aims to develop a type of ICMS tax collection simulator in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The developed tool uses public and historical fuel price data together with several deep learning models to generate an ICMS collection forecasting system. In this way, it is possible to modify fuel prices in order to predict potential impacts on ICMS tax collection. In this way, using the tool, it is possible to avoid a sudden drop in revenue, even from a tax increase. This study also highlighted the relationship among the collected revenues, the fuel's price and consumption and the local economy activity indicator. Moreover it showed that keeping the fuel prices around a stable value over a year period results in no difference on state collection.  © 2023 IEEE.",Applied Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Public administration; Tax revenues prediction,Costs; Deep learning; Economics; Fuel economy; Learning systems; Public administration; Taxation; Applied neural network; Deep learning; Fuel prices; Fuel tax; Neural-networks; Price fluctuation; Price-based; Tax revenue; Tax revenue prediction; Transport services; Forecasting,,IEEE Computer Society,21615322,979-835031943-9,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190151806

As a result, most major cities in the United States have started to collect an “occupancy tax” for Airbnb bookings. In this study, we investigate the heterogeneous treatment effects of the occupancy tax policy on Airbnb listings, using a combination of a generalized causal forest methodology and a difference-in-differences framework. While we find that the introduction of the tax significantly reduces both listing revenues and sales, more importantly, these effects are disproportionately more pronounced for residential hosts with single shared-space (nontarget) listings versus commercial hosts with multiple properties or entire-space (target) listings. We further show that this unintended consequence is caused by customers' discriminatory tax aversion against nontarget listings. We then leverage these empirical results by prescribing how hosts should optimally set prices in response to the occupancy tax and identify the discriminatory tax rates that would equalize the tax's effect across nontarget and target listings.

This study proposes a model called SHIELD for detecting these violations through unstructured data in social media. The process involves collecting 2,373,570 records of commercial goods from social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook in three phases. In Phase 1, keywords for labeling are collected for text classification. Three categories of results are defined: Red Line for smuggled goods, unpaid duty, prohibited goods, and restricted goods; Green Line for non-commercial goods; and Inspect for goods that cannot be identified from the text and require further investigation. Phase 2 and Phase 3 use keywords to detect smugglers from unstructured social media data for labeling grouped by three algorithms of Logistic Regression (LR), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), employed to classify imported illegal products. The results of all tests show that the LSTM technique had the best accuracy of 99.44% and the best average F1 score of 90.55%. Using algorithms and techniques such as LR, GRU, and LSTM demonstrates the potential of machine learning and natural language processing in detecting illegal activities and promoting economic security. © 2024 The Author(s)",Commercial goods; Customs duties; Gated Recurrent Unit; Logistic Regression; Long short-term memory; Unstructured data,,,Elsevier Inc.,27726622,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183961124

Inspired by such a large-scale tax reformation, we developed an experimental approach to analyze the reactions of public sentiment on Twitter based on popular words either directly or indirectly related to GST. We collected a number of almost 200 k tweets solely about GST from June 2017 to December 2017 in two phases. In order to assure the relevance of our crawled tweets with respect to GST, we prepared a topic-sentiment relevance model. Furthermore, we employed several state-of-the-art lexicons for identifying sentiment words and assigned polarity ratings to each of the tweets. On the other hand, in order to extract the relevant words that are linked with GST implicitly, we propose a new polarity-popularity framework and such popular words were also rated with sentiments. Next, we trained an LSTM model using both types of rated words for predicting sentiment on GST tweets and obtained an overall accuracy of 84.51%. It was observed that the performance of the system has been started improving while incorporating the knowledge of indirectly related GST words during training. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.",Deep learning; GST; lexicons; LSTM; sentiment analysis; Twitter,Taxation; Experimental approaches; Overall accuracies; Public sentiments; Relevance models; Sentiment classification; State of the art; Long short-term memory,,Springer,2562499,,SAPSE,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085704575

Hence, everyone tends to express their opinions on social media or e-commerce websites about commercial products, movies, sports, social and geopolitical matters and even on government policies. These opinions reflect the corresponding person's view or sentiment about that particular matter, which ultimately leads to the formation of opinion polarity regarding a specific issue. In today's context, Twitter, Facebook or other social platforms often witness a lot of opinion waves regarding some of the today's most hot topics, and one of them surely is the introduction of Goods and Services Tax or GST in India. The rising sentiment analysis and opinion mining regarding this issue is helping researchers to understand the insight of public emotion. It can be also implemented to gain an idea of allover opinion polarity of people in this matter.

Tax morality is also known as the ethics of compliance. It is the independent cause that motivates a positive tax behaviour. Employees’ religious beliefs may impact their ideas and actions in organizational life, just as individuals’ attitudes, values, emotions, abilities, and behaviours influence their thoughts and actions at work. Religion can positively influence a worker’s loyalty, morale, and communication. In this context, the research seeks to determine whether religiosity and religion may have an effect on tax morale, examining whether an individual’s religiosity reduces tax evasion and increases the degree of tax morale. Using machine learning variable selection techniques appropriate for categorical variables, we have used the dataset of the Joint EVS/WVS 2017-2020 (European Value Survey/World Value Survey), allowing for comparisons of tax morality in more than 79 nations globally (chi-squared and mutual information). The empirical findings showed that the most important aspects of religiosity, such as religious denomination, belief in God, and the significance of God, along with the degree of trust placed in other religions and churches, have a considerable positive impact on the level of tax morale. Another significant conclusion relates to how much people feel the government is responsible, how much they care about their nation, and how satisfied they are with the political system—findings that have been shown to boost employee morale. The following are a person’s primary traits that indicate their financial morale: an adult above the age of 25, a full-time worker or retired person, married, and living alone. Therefore, employees that are morally upright, trustworthy, diligent, and committed to the workplace values of justice and decency raise morale generally and improve an organisation’s success. A business may enhance its reputation and help to secure its long-term success by establishing behavioural policies. © 2022 by the authors.",Joint EVS/WVS 2017-2020; religion; religiosity; tax compliance; tax morale; variable selection method; work environment,,,MDPI,22277390,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143603876

Francisco de Paula Santander, Cúcuta, Colombia; Secretaría de Hacienda Distrital, Bogotá, Colombia","Tax fraud is the intentional act of lying on a tax return form with intent to lower one's tax liability. Under-reporting is one of the most common types of tax fraud, it consists in filling a tax return form with a lesser tax base. As a result of this act, fiscal revenues are reduced, undermining public investment. Detecting tax fraud is one of the main priorities of local tax authorities which are required to develop cost-efficient strategies to tackle this problem. Most of the recent works in tax fraud detection are based on supervised machine learning techniques that make use of labeled or audit-assisted data. Regrettably, auditing tax declarations is a slow and costly process, therefore access to labeled historical information is extremely limited. For this reason, the applicability of supervised machine learning techniques for tax fraud detection is severely hindered. Such limitations motivate the contribution of this work. We present a novel approach for the detection of potential fraudulent tax payers using only unsupervised learning techniques and allowing the future use of supervised learning techniques. We demonstrate the ability of our model to identify under-reporting taxpayers on real tax payment declarations, reducing the number of potential fraudulent tax payers to audit. The obtained results demonstrate that our model doesn't miss on marking declarations as suspicious and labels previously undetected tax declarations as suspicious, increasing the operational efficiency in the tax supervision process without needing historic labeled data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Anomaly detection; Kernel density estimation; Spectral clustering; Tax fraud detection; Unsupervised machine learning,Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Crime; Data mining; Economics; Investments; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Anomaly detection; Fraud detection; Kernel Density Estimation; Spectral clustering; Unsupervised machine learning; Taxation,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145035552-0,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051492335

MaLDIVE consists of a 4-step pipeline: ( {i} ) a social network is built from the taxpayers data and several features of this network are extracted by computing both classical social network indexes and domain-specific indexes; (ii) an initial set of risky taxpayers is identified by applying machine learning algorithms; (iii) the set of risky taxpayers is possibly enlarged by means of an information diffusion strategy and the output is shown to the analyst through a network visualization system; (iv) a visual inspection of the network is performed by the analyst in order to validate and refine the set of risky taxpayers.

Ideally, one may wish to completely automate the data analysis process, but in many real-world applications a full automation may pose significant risks. In these cases, human analysts must be directly involved to refine the analysis or to make the final decisions. A challenging problem, therefore, is how to perform efficient and trustworthy decision-making when humans are an integral part of the analysis pipeline. We propose a “human-in-the-loop” methodology that leverages data mining, machine learning, and visual analytics to improve and speed up the analysis. A key feature is the use of a dashboard that integrates intuitive visual tools, which aid analysts to efficiently discover hidden data patterns or to get helpful insights. We describe in particular how this methodology has been successfully applied to support Revenue Agency officers in tax risk assessment. © 2022, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

Tax departments and public security departments are facing increasingly a serious crime situation that has created a new challenge. By studying the current trend of false invoice crime, the difficulties of investigation in such cases are analyzed. Using the tax information of enterprises that have conducted false invoice as the breakthrough point, the machine learning method is introduced to build a risk pre-warning assessment model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to detect enterprises issuing false invoices. Three steps were designed in this paper. First, a risk pre-warning assessment model was established to detect enterprises issuing false invoices. Second, enterprises were classified into three groups according to the risk levels: A, B, and C. Third, collected data were used to make an empirical analysis, and the results show that the accuracy rate of the model is 97%. In China, due to the high crime rate of tax fraud cases, it is important to obtain data from tax and public security departments to establish a model that can detect such crimes as early as possible. The police and tax authorities can use this model to jointly combat such crimes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Crime risk assessment; Risk early warning model; VAT invoice crime,,,Palgrave Macmillan,14603799,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102510378

We utilise variational inequality techniques within a multicriteria decision-making framework and validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations using a machine learning augmented algorithm. By employing this approach, we position the Agricultural Sector Roadmap, aimed at capping global warming at 1.5°C, within the wider agricultural sector's climate action framework. Our results demonstrate that environmental taxation emerges as the most effective approach for addressing climate change. Eco-taxation leads to a 57.87 per cent reduction in global emissions, whereas climate pledges only account for a 20.59 per cent reduction at the same level of production. Furthermore, eco-taxation results in a 45.68 per cent greater reduction in emission intensity compared to climate pledges. In contrast to climate commitments, an eco-fiscal policy is capable of achieving the objectives established by the European Union.  © 2024 The Author(s).

However, contemporary research often involves developing reinforcement learning (RL) based models that focus solely on a single type of agents, such as households, firms, or the government. Such an approach overlooks the adaptation of interacting agents thereby failing to capture the complexity of real-world economic systems. In this work, we consider a multi-agent simulator comprised of RL agents of numerous types, including heterogeneous households, firm, central bank and government. In particular, we focus on the crucial role of the government in distributing tax credits to households. We conduct two broad categories of comprehensive experiments dealing with the impact of tax credits on 1) households with varied degrees of myopia (short-sightedness in spending and saving decisions), and 2) households with diverse liquidity profiles. The first category of experiments examines the impact of the frequency of tax credits (e.g. annual vs quarterly) on consumption patterns of myopic households. The second category of experiments focuses on the impact of varying tax credit distribution strategies on households with differing liquidities. We validate our simulation model by reproducing trends observed in real households upon receipt of unforeseen, uniform tax credits, as documented in a JPMorgan Chase report. Based on the results of the latter, we propose an innovative tax credit distribution strategy for the government to reduce inequality among households. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in improving social welfare in our simulation results.  © 2024 ACM.",,Decision making; Digital elevation model; Intelligent agents; Reinforcement learning; Taxation; Decisions makings; Distribution strategies; Economic models; Household behavior; Interacting agents; Learning Based Models; Multi agent; Real-world; Reinforcement learnings; Tax credits; Multi agent systems,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,979-840071081-0,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214892360

Clearly, the results of these systems must be generalized by a high value of accuracy to be acceptable by related systems to identify tax fraud. In this paper, a new method based on P300-based component has been proposed for detection of tax fraud. To this end, the test protocol is designed based on Odd-ball paradigm concealed information recognition. This test was done on 40 people and their brain signals were acquired. After prepossessing, the classic features are extracted from each single trial. After that, time-frequency (TF) transformation is applied on the sweeps and TF features are produced thereupon. Then, the best combinational feature vector is selected in order to improve classifier accuracy. Finally, guilty and innocent persons are classified by K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. We found that combination of time-frequency and classic features has better ability to achieve higher amount of accuracy to identify the unrealistic tax returns. The obtained results show that the proposed method can detect deception by the accuracy of 91% which is better than other previously reported methods. This study, for the first time, succeeded in presenting a novel method for identifying unrealistic tax returns through EEG signal processing, which has significantly improved the yield of this study compared to the previous literature. © 2022 National Taiwan University.",Electroencephalography; Lie-detection; Odd-ball paradigm; P300 component; Tax fraud; Unrealistic tax returns,Crime; Electrophysiology; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Taxation; Detection system; Learning-based approach; Lie detection; Machine-learning; Odd-ball paradigm; P300 component; Tax fraud; Tax returns; Uncertainty; Unrealistic tax return; adult; article; classifier; deception; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; fraud; human; k nearest neighbor; lie detection; multilayer perceptron; signal processing; Electroencephalography,,World Scientific,10162372,,YIGOE,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121982941

The purpose is to improve the work efficiency of relevant personnel of real estate tax base assessment, reduce workload pressure, and improve the evaluation level. Real estate tax base assessment and real estate appraisal are studied in detail, and the factors of the real estate tax base assessment index are analyzed. Different real estate tax base assessment methods are compared, and the difference and connection between different methods are explored. The theory of batch assessment of real estate tax base is analyzed in depth, and the procedures for batch assessment implementation are summarized. On this basis, a deep learning neural network (DLNN) theory is proposed, and a real estate tax base assessment model based on DLNN is constructed. The reliability, accuracy, and relative superiority of the model are analyzed in detail, and the model is used to test the sample data and analyze the error. The results reveal that the DLNN model has better data fit and good reliability. Compared with other algorithms, it has certain advantages and smaller error values. In the sample test, the test value is closer to the actual value, the error is controllable, and it has high accuracy. Through training, it shows that the DL model has an excellent performance in tax base assessment, can meet the requirements of efficient batch assessment, and is expected to achieve the goal of completing a huge workload in a limited time and improve work efficiency.

States need sufficient tax funds to finance public goods such as health care or education. Tax psychology aims to understand citizens’ tax behaviour and to analyse the psychological processes that determine tax honesty. The chapter gives an overview of the history of taxation, the different qualities of tax behaviour, the socio-demographic, economic, psychological, third party and cultural determinants of tax compliance as well as the theoretical models of tax behaviour. Throughout the chapter, research gaps and future research avenues are described. In addition, the most important drivers of future tax research are discussed, including the analyses of interactions between tax compliance determinants, the application of new methods such as field experiments applying machine learning, the boundary conditions and consequences of digitalization and research on tax behaviour in developing and emerging markets. © Katharina Gangl and Erich Kirchler 2019.

Efficient detection of tax evasion has always been a crucial issue for both governments and academic researchers. Recent research has proposed the use of machine learning technology to detect tax evasion and has shown good results in some specific areas. Regrettably, there are still two major obstacles to detect tax evasion. First, it is hard to extract powerful features because of the complexity of tax data. Second, due to the complicated process of tax auditing, labeled data are limited in practice. Such obstacles motivate the contributions of this work. In this paper, we propose a novel tax evasion detection framework named FBNE-PU (Fusion of the basic feature and network embedding with PU learning for tax evasion detection), a multistage method for detecting tax evasion in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the transaction network and propose a novel network embedding algorithm, the PnCGCN. It significantly improves detection performance by extracting powerful features from basic features and the tax-related transaction network. Moreover, we use nnPU (positive-unlabeled learning with non-negative risk estimator) to assign pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Finally, an MLP is trained as the decision function. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the comparison methods in the tax evasion detection task.

The European Union (EU) alone handles 4693 tons of goods every minute (2018 figures). Even though 70% of goods are imported at zero tariff, the EU raised EUR 25.4 billions in 2018, and customs-related income transferred by member states to the EU accounts for nearly 13% of its overall budget. In this field, (a) the conflicting objectives are qualitative and cannot be reduced to a common measure (security and terrorism, health, drug market access control, taxes, etc.); (b) each submitted item has dozens of characteristics; (c) there are constraints; and (d) risk analysis systems have to make decisions in real time. Although the World Customs Organization has promoted the use of artificial intelligence to increase the precision of controls, the problem is very complex due to the data characteristics and interpretability, which is a requirement established by customs officers. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian-based hybrid approach combining machine learning and multi-objective linear programming (MOLP), called multi-objective Bayesian with dynamic optimization (MOBADO). We demonstrate that it is possible to more than double (with a 237% increase) the precision of current inspection systems, freeing up almost 50% of human resources, and outperform past results with respect to each of the above objectives. MOBADO is an optimization technique that could be combined with any artificial intelligence approach capable of optimizing the quality of multi-objective risk analysis in real time. © 2021 by the authors.

Several initiatives to combat tax fraud have successfully used data analysis and Machine Learning techniques. This work sought to investigate the use of these techniques in identifying a specific practice of tax fraud, practiced by shell companies, formed exclusively to issue non-due ICMS credits, the tax on operations related to the circulation of goods, and the provision of interstate, intercity, and communication services. Based on document analysis and consultation with auditors and specialists, typologies and variables relevant to identifying tax evasion events carried out by shell companies were identified. Around these variables, data from the Finance Department of the Federal District were collected and prepared. With this data, it was possible to explore the use of predictive models based on Machine Learning capable of pointing out potentially fraudulent behavior. The good results obtained by these models demonstrate their potential as part of systematic monitoring and fiscal audits by tax authorities. © 2024, Fundacao Getulio Vargas.

The former include grants, loans, and workstudy and intend to help students finance or afford college attendance, persistence, and graduation. Post-purchase policies are designed to minimize financial burdens associated with having invested in college attendance and are granted as tax incentives/expenditures. One of these expenditures is the IRS’s Student Loan Interest Deduction (SLID)—which offers up to $2500 as an adjustment for taxable income based on having paid interest on student loans and has an annual cost of $12.81 billion—about 45.7% of the Pell grant cost. Despite this high cost, SLID has remained virtually unstudied. Accordingly, the study’s purpose is to assess how (in)effective SLID may be in reaching lower-income taxpayers. To address this purpose, we relied on an innovative analytic framework “multilevel modelling with spatial interaction effects” that allowed controlling for contextual and systemic observed and unobserved factors that may both affect college participation and may be related with SLID disbursements over and above income prospects. Data sources included the IRS, ACS, FBI, IPEDS, and the NPSAS:2015–2016. Findings revealed that SLID is regressive at the top, wealthier taxpayers and students attending more expensive colleges realize higher tax benefits than lower income taxpayers and students. Indeed, 75% of community college students were found to not be eligible to receive SLID—data and replication code (https://cutt.ly/COyfdKC) are provided. Is this the best use of this multibillion tax incentive? Is SLID designed to exclude the poorest, neediest students? A policy similar to Education Credits, focused on outstanding debt rather than on interest, that targets below-poverty line students with up to $5000 in debt, would represent a true commitment, and better use of public funds, to close socioeconomic gaps, by helping those more prone to default. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Bayesian spatial statistics; Community colleges & public 2-year colleges; Data science; Data visualization; Economic geography; Economic sociology; Equity; Geographical information systems; Geography of advantage and disadvantage; Geography of disadvantage; Geopolitics; Hierarchical simultaneous autorregressive models; Higher education finance; Machine learning; Multilevel modelling with spatial interaction effects; Neighborhood effects; Policy analysis; Post-purchase federal financial aid policies; Regressive at the top policies; Reproducible research; Social and spatial context; Social policy; Social stratification; Spatial econometrics; Tax breaks incentives; Taxable income,,,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,3610365,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124021232

(b) If so, would it be the best solution in any case? (c) What is the effect size of the different strategies that proposed? We have proved the viability of a new method using as an exemplary case the selection for VAT control in the Spanish Tax Agency (Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria—AEAT) and verified the approach using microdata of customs taxes. The new method improves fraudster detection precision in VAT by 13.82%, which is increased from an average of 82.28 to 96.10%.

This work explores the problem of determining the strategy a self-interested, risk-averse tax entity is expected to follow, as it “navigates” – in the context of a Markov Decision Process – a government-controlled tax environment that includes random audits, penalties and occasional tax amnesties. Although simplified versions of this problem have been previously explored, the mere assumption of risk-aversion (as opposed to risk-neutrality) raises the complexity of finding the optimal policy well beyond the reach of analytical techniques. Here, we obtain approximate solutions via a combination of Q-learning and recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning. By doing so, we (i) determine the tax evasion behavior expected of the taxpayer entity, (ii) calculate the degree of risk aversion of the “average” entity given empirical estimates of tax evasion, and (iii) evaluate sample tax policies, in terms of expected revenues.

[Methods] First, we use web-scraping, text mining, and other methods to collect business financial data, executive information, and media coverage of the corporations. Then, we used the random forest method for feature selection and established indictors for the candidate companies. Then, we built a discriminatory model with the multi-task sparse structure learning based on the improved focal loss function. Finally, we trained the model with different types of tax audits to identify the needed candidates. [Results] We examined our model with real world datasets and found it had good performance for various applications. Its mean recall rate reached 0.830 9, which was 0.135 1 and 0.103 3 higher than the logistic method and the traditional multi-task sparse structure learning. [Limitations] The model needs to be examined with datasets not from the listed companies. [Conclusions] The new model could identify the target enterprises with various dishonest tax evasions.

The tax administration is such an area that requires massive data processing to identify hidden patterns and trends of possible tax evasion. The use of supervised methods can be effective in these cases, but the lack of available labeled data limits their practical application in real-world scenarios. An alternative is the use of unsupervised methods, which have potential benefits in certain cases. In this sense, unsupervised methods are considered to be feasible as a decision support tool in tax evasion risk management systems. This paper proposes an unsupervised approach to identify signs of tax evasion by detecting, possible, tax underreporting. The proposed strategy is evaluated on a data set associated with individual income tax statistics of the United States.

The Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) results reveal a resounding commitment among EU member states to diminish their reliance on incineration, which is evident through adopting green technologies and environmentally conscious taxation policies, aligning with the European Union's sustainability objectives. However, this transition presents the intricate task of harmonizing industrial emissions management with efficient waste disposal. Tailoring waste management strategies to accommodate diverse consumption patterns and unique circumstances within individual member states becomes imperative. Cointegrating regressions highlighted the long-run relationship among the selected variables, while Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) and Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) estimates roughly confirmed MMQR results. ML analyses, conducted through two ensemble methods (Gradient Boosting, GB, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) shed light on the relative importance of the predictors: in particular, environmental taxation, consumption-based emissions, and production-based emissions greatly contribute to determining the variation of combustible renewables and waste. This study recommends that EU countries establish monitoring mechanisms to advance waste management and environmental sustainability through green technology adoption, enhance environmental taxation policies, and accelerate the renewable energy transition. © 2024",Carbon emissions; Eco-friendly technologies; Energy transition; Environmental taxes; EU countries; Incineration; Machine learning; Panel data,Carbon; Climate Change; European Union; Incineration; Taxes; Waste Management; Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Environmental management; Information management; Machine learning; Method of moments; Sustainable development; Taxation; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; carbon; Carbon emissions; Eco-friendly technologies; Energy transitions; Environmental sustainability; Environmental taxes; European union; European Union countries; Machine-learning; Panel data; Quantile regression; alternative energy; carbon emission; environmental policy; environmental tax; European Union; incineration; machine learning; panel data; sustainability; technology adoption; waste disposal; article; carbon emission; climate change; controlled study; environmental sustainability; European Union; fiscal policy; incineration; least square analysis; machine learning; quantile regression; renewable energy; renewable resource; tax; waste disposal; waste management; procedures; Environmental technology,,Academic Press,3014797,,JEVMA,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85195697763

Our methodology embraced the following steps: data extraction; data preparation; dimensionality reduction; model training and testing; model evaluation; model selection. Our experimental findings revealed that Sammon Mapping (SM) combined with Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) outranked other state-of-the-art works, classifiers and dimensionality reduction techniques as regards classification performance. Our belief is that the ensemble of classifiers of GBT, combined with SM’s ability to identify relevant dimensions in data, contributed to produce higher prediction scores. These scores enable São Paulo’s tax administration to rank fiscal audits according to the highest probabilities of tax crime occurrence, leveraging tax revenue. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Audit; Crime; Data; Decision-making; Fiscal; Gradient Boosted Trees; Machine Learning; Revenue; Sammon Mapping; Tax,Crime; Decision making; Dimensionality reduction; Forestry; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Mapping; Taxation; Classification performance; Data driven decision; Data preparation; Dimensionality reduction techniques; Ensemble of classifiers; Model evaluation; Predictive power; State of the art; Classification (of information),Filipe J.; Śmiałek M.; Brodsky A.; Hammoudi S.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18651348,978-303075417-4,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106441961

The government sector is following this trend, aiming to accelerate the decision-making process and improve the efficiency of operations. The predictive capabilities of Machine Learning strengthen the decision-making process. The main motivation of this work is to use Machine Learning to aid decision-making in fiscal audit plans related to service taxes of the municipality of São Paulo. In this work, we applied Machine Learning to predict crimes against the service tax system of São Paulo. In our methods, we structured a process comprised of the following steps: feature selection; data extraction from our databases; data partitioning; model training and testing; model evaluation; model validation. Our results demonstrated that Random Forests prevailed over other learning algorithms in terms of tax crime prediction performance. Our results also showed Random Forests' capability to generalize to new data. We believe that the supremacy of Random Forests is due to the synergy of its ensemble of trees, which contributed to improve tax crime prediction performance. With better predictions, our audit plans became more assertive. Consequently, this rises taxpayers' compliance with tax laws and increases tax revenue.

Special knowledge involves difficult words. It requires users to raise a series of questions and get the answers to them to pinpoint the desired information. And, conversational Q&A is appropriate than the traditional Q&A because it allows a user to narrow down searches in a solution space. To transform a given set of Q&As to conversational Q&A system for special knowledge search, we first explore not only the present traditional Q&A systems and conversational Q&A systems for general knowledge search, but also those for special knowledge search. From this, we induce an appropriate search process in conversational Q&A systems for special knowledge. Secondly, we build an ontology with the help of machine learning to support the navigation in special knowledge. Finally, we give a way to evaluate performance after embedding the ontology on our search process of conversational Q&A. We apply this procedure to the case of Korean simplified taxation in a Korean Q&A system, Naver Jisik-In Q&A. We found that searching through Jisik-In Q&A with ontology has better usability than using Jisik-In Q&A only. Therefore, this study aims to improve the usability of special knowledge search, lower the threshold of special knowledge, and develop special knowledge as general as common knowledge using conversational Q&A based on ontology. However, as the number of user experimented is limited and the classifier for the extracted words from existing Q&A system should be reviewed by tax expert, so the future work is demanded. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conversational Q&A; Ontology; Search behavior; Special knowledge; Transformation,Human computer interaction; Taxation; Chatbot; Common knowledge; General knowledge; Search behavior; Search process; Solution space; Special knowledge; Transformation; Ontology,Stephanidis C.; Antona M.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18650929,978-303030711-0,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075837901

Although it is true that paying taxes is a responsibility, it also entitles citizens to claim control over government spending, which may facilitate a greater democratization of a country’s political regime. Consistent with this reasoning, a growing body of scholarship has documented a positive relationship between the size of tax revenues extracted by the state and the adherence of the country’s regime to democratic values. What has been left underexplored is the role in this relationship of the media, a commonly available and relied-upon source of information about taxpaying for the public. This study offers a first contribution in this direction, by exploring the relationship between the nature of the political regime and the rhetorical construction of the concept of a taxpayer in the national press. Based on an automated content analysis of articles (N=24,969) published by ninety-two newspapers and news agencies in fifty-one countries using a set of pretrained and validated machine-learning algorithms, the study demonstrates that the less democratic a state is, the more likely it is for the national press to frame a taxpayer as a subordinate in a hierarchical relationship with the state, by discussing taxpaying in tax collection, rather than public spending, terms. The study furthers a more nuanced understanding of the place of the media in the taxation-democratization link and demonstrates the applicability of the supervised machine-learning approach to classifying frames in large cross-national samples of newspaper data. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.",computer-assisted text analysis; democratization; media framing; news; supervised machine learning; taxation,,,SAGE Publications Inc.,19401612,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046685680

Consequently, the Chinese government has implemented a water resource tax policy in certain regions, with the aim of compelling manufacturing enterprises to adopt green and energy-saving innovations. This study used panel data from Chinese manufacturing companies listed on the A-share market from 2009 to 2020 and employed a double machine learning model to explore whether the water resource fee-to-tax reform can compel enterprises to enhance their tripartite green energy-saving innovation drive. These innovations consist of vision-driven and mission-driven green energy-saving technological innovations and green management energy-saving innovations. Following a quasi-natural experiment, our findings revealed the following: (1) The water resource fee-to-tax policy promoted the internal coupling coordination of the triple-driven system. (2) The policy compelled progress in mission-driven green energy-saving technological innovations and green energy-saving management innovations but hindered vision-driven green energy-saving technological innovations. (3) Within the internal systems of manufacturing enterprises, green energy-saving management innovations play a positive mediating role between the water resource fee-to-tax policy and the mission-driven green energy-saving technology innovation subsystem, but they lack a similar positive mediating mechanism for the vision-driven green energy-saving technology innovation subsystem. (4) The counterfactual framework verified that the mechanistic pathway “water resource fee-to-tax → green energy-saving management innovation → mission-driven/vision-driven green energy-saving technological innovation” could be further extended to other manufacturing enterprises not currently under policy compulsion. (5) In the interaction system between manufacturing enterprises and external markets, the development of marketization and financial technology positively regulated the promoting effect of the water resource fee-to-tax policy on mission-driven green energy-saving technological innovations and green energy-saving management innovations, but it did not have a similar effect on vision-driven green energy-saving technological innovations. © 2024 by the authors.",double machine learning; green energy-saving management innovation; mission-driven energy-saving technological innovation; vision-driven energy-saving technological innovation; water resource fee-to-tax reform,Commerce; Digital storage; Emission control; Engineering education; Machine learning; Taxation; Water resources; Double machine learning; Energy  savings; Energy saving managements; Energy-savings; Green energy savings; Green energy-saving management innovation; Machine-learning; Management innovation; Mission-driven; Mission-driven energy-saving technological innovation; Tax reform; Technological innovation; Vision-driven energy-saving technological innovation; Water resource fee-to-tax reform; Water resources fees; Energy conservation,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),19961073,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197240616

The proposed methods are applied to the choice of coinsurance rates in health insurance, using data from the RAND health insurance experiment. The key trade-off in this setting is between transfers toward the sick and insurance costs. The key empirical relationship the policy maker needs to learn about is the response of health care expenditures to coinsurance rates.

In this paper, we use extreme multilabel text classification approach to predict paragraphs, articles, and laws relevant to an appeal on the Indonesian Tax Court Ruling documents. Traditional machine learning methods, such as random forest, can produce a good performance for an extreme multilabel text classification problem but requires training a huge number of separate classifiers. Meanwhile, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) can effectively solve the extreme multilabel text classification problem. Furthermore, the use of IndoBERT embedding to represent Indonesian text in multilabel classification problems has not been explored much. This research proposes a single channel CNN model with IndoBERT embedding to solve extreme multilabel text classification problems on Indonesian Tax Court Ruling documents. We use three labeling scenarios: paragraph-level label scenario, article-level label scenario, and law-level label scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model (CNN+IndoBERT) outperforms the single channel CNN with Word2Vec embedding and the single channel CNN with fastText embedding in all three labeling scenarios.

To this end, we devise a novel Gated Mixture Variational Autoencoder deep network, that can be effectively trained with data from a limited number of audited taxpayers, combined with a large corpus of filed VAT returns. This gives rise to a semi-supervised learning framework that leverages the latest advances in deep learning and robust regularization using variational inference. We developed our approach in collaboration with the Cyprus Tax Department and experimentally deployed it to facilitate its audit selection process; to this end, we used actual VAT data from Cyprus-based taxpayers. This way, we obtained strong empirical evidence that our approach can greatly facilitate the VAT audit case selection process.

Creation of the artifacts was done in cycles as alpha, beta and gamma where alpha and beta were a neural network and gamma a self-organizing map. Alpha reached a macro average of 0.75–0.78 in classification and beta 0.77–0.79. Gamma gave a different point of view on the problem and was able to clearly identify the class's non-estimated customers in a topographical map.

To correct for unobserved heterogeneity, we endogenously identify latent classes/subtypes of individuals that share similar patterns on how their support for taxation is affected by their unobserved and observed characteristics, including remittance dependency. We apply the finite multilevel mixture of regressions approach, a supervised machine learning method to detect hidden classes in the data without imposing a priori assumptions on class membership. Our data are best generated by an econometric model with two classes/subtypes of individuals. In class 1 where more than two-thirds of the citizens belong, we do not find any significant evidence that remittance dependence affects support for taxation. However, in class 2 where the remaining one-third of the citizens belong, we find a significant negative effect of remittance dependence on support for taxation. Furthermore, we find that citizens who have a positive appraisal of the quality of the public service delivery have a lower probability of belonging to the class in which depending on remittance reduces support for taxation. The findings emphasize the need for efficient public services provisioning to counteract the adverse effect of remittances on tax morale.  © The Author(s), 2023.

The aim of this study is to assess interaction between taxpayers,controlling bodies and public authorities in view of dominant paradigms andresults of expert and sociological research on subjects with regard to the degreeof their influence on tax environment climate. Interaction is defined as a certaintype of relations between subjects that result in developing mutual influencewhich induces corresponding changes of their states. Interaction is essentially apoorly structured category, which dictates a need to use soft modeling andsubjective evaluation methods (matrix models). According to the degree ofinfluence on tax environment climate, public authorities are proved to be the mostinfluential subject, while taxpayers are found to be the least influential.Summative value of subjects' interaction is set as Very Good. It is determined bytaxpayers' data as the best among other subjects. Based on the analysis ofdynamics in parameters and activity of interaction subjects it is argued that inorder to improve subjects' interaction productivity, it is appropriate to improvethe mechanisms of subjects' interaction with public authorities of all others. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

While existing studies indicate that public opposition to carbon taxes is influenced by climate change belief and by political trust, less is known about the relevance of other factors. Moreover, it remains unclear why people oppose carbon taxes more fiercely than other climate policies. To enhance understanding of carbon tax opposition, I synthesize and categorize 28 conditions that potentially provoke public opposition to carbon taxes, assess their independent importance for predicting carbon tax opposition, and review the specific form in which they predict carbon tax opposition. This analysis draws on data from approximately 44,400 individuals from 23 European countries. It uses a random forest model, a machine learning method, to estimate independent prediction effects. The results identify the feeling of personal responsibility for trying to reduce climate change as the most important condition for predicting opposition to carbon taxes and for predicting attitudes on other climate policies. Political trust, in contrast, strongly predicts carbon tax opposition but not attitudes on other climate policies, suggesting that low political trust could explain the peculiar public aversion against carbon taxes. Recycling revenues from existing carbon prices back to households, often considered crucial for securing public support, is only associated with minor increases in the acceptance of higher carbon taxes. Finally, the results reveal that age, market liberal values, and good governance are related to carbon tax opposition in a non-monotonous pattern. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Public attitudes; Public opinion; Random forest,,,Elsevier Ltd,22146296,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099447771

Given this backdrop, this paper analyses the drivers of corporate tax rates during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., in 2020 and 2021). The results from 113 advanced and developing economies show that a higher level of the COVID-19-related uncertainty is positively associated with the corporate tax rates. Similarly, the country size (measured by total population) increases the corporate tax rates. Per capita income is negatively related to the corporate tax rates, but this evidence is insufficient to consider different estimation techniques. The paper also discusses potential fiscal policy implications for the driving mechanism of corporate tax rates for the post-COVID-19 era.

CT levies taxes on the energy generation while CAT directly limits the total carbon emission in the system. Hence, in practice, CAT is more adjustable than CT due to the long legislation process for altering tax rate, though CT is much easier to implement. In this paper, we seek to learn the most effective tax rate through CAT programs by establishing the equivalence between CT and CAT. Through bridging the two schemes, we use numerical study to highlight the different dynamics for the schemes to converge to the equivalent point. © 2022 IEEE.",Cap and trade; Carbon reduction; Carbon tax; Machine learning,Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Global warming; Machine learning; Cap and trade; Cap-and-trade program; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Carbon taxes; Energy generations; Learn+; Machine-learning; Tax rates; Total carbon; Taxation,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166541104-2,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137357898

We attempt to predict firms’ engagement in tax avoidance using CEOs’ flying hobby measured by the pilot certificate. Using various advanced machine learning methods, we find that CEOs’ hobby of flying airplanes is significantly associated with increased corporate tax avoidance. In particular, we find CEOs with a student, private, or airline transport pilot certificate are more likely to engage in corporate tax avoidance while CEOs with a commercial pilot certificate are less likely to engage in corporate tax avoidance.

Grocery transaction data, with price, discounting and other information for beverage products, present an opportunity to evaluate the likely effects of taxation policy. Sales are often non-linearly associated with price and are affected by the prices of multiple competing brands. We evaluated the predictive performance of Boosted Decision Tree Regression (B-DTR) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that account for the non-linearity and competition across brands, and compared their performance to a benchmark regression, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). B-DTR and DNN showed a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) of prediction in the sales of most major SSB brands in comparison to LASSO, indicating a superior accuracy in predicting the effectiveness of SSB taxation.

In order to address this specific problem, this paper propose the artificial neural network (ANN) as one of machine learning method, to construct a model for the non-tax revenue plan based on the previous series data and analyze for dependent variables. ANN with its functionality in learning process can help this process by extracting the patterns formed in previous annual non-tax revenue data and related non-tax revenue variable, to get the most accurate model prediction.

Simulating the behavior of different agents within an economic system can aid policymakers in evaluating the potential consequences of various economic policies, thereby facilitating the development of more effective policies. However, conventional agent-based modeling (ABM) is limited by hand-crafted interaction rules, resulting in a heavy reliance on simulated outcomes in formulating static individual behaviors. In this work, we propose an adaptive interaction framework to dynamically model the effects of various taxation policies within the Real-Business-Cycle (RBC) simulation system. The RBC system simulates the interaction between workers, firms, and the government to explain economic fluctuations and conduct economic policy evaluations in the business cycle. In contrast to previous works, our framework allows mutual adaptation among all interacting members to attain a dynamic equilibrium, yielding a more accurate representation of real-world economic operation. Specifically, the decision-making process of the government is driven by a deep reinforcement learning agent, enabling it to update taxation policies based on different objective signals from the RBC system. Additionally, workers and firms can also adjust their behaviors through imitation learning, aiming to optimize their utility under various taxation policies. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can capture the complex dynamics of various interacting agents and effectively evaluate the effects of different taxation policies. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based modeling; Deep reinforcement learning; Real-business-cycle system; Taxation policy evaluation,Contrastive Learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Adaptive interaction; Agent-based model; Business cycles; Cycle systems; Interaction framework; Policy evaluation; Real-business-cycle system; Reinforcement learnings; Taxation policy evaluation; Workers',,Elsevier Ltd,9574174,,ESAPE,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85214315195

The tax risk profile of South African construction companies is characterized by the book value, the cash flow position, headcount, firm earnings, debt size, and the type of firm. The model that defines this tax risk is a Neural Network (NN) boosted Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The main aim of this study is to develop an artificial intelligent pricing model. This model will be presented as a tool that can be used for tax liability insurance underwriting. This study was conducted using an examination of financial statements of construction companies. Such an examination was done using 10 years worth of financial data. For a view on company option data, utilization of standard bank data came in handy, while that of major economic events was obtained qualitatively from industrial clips and Statistics South Africa (Stats SA). Model ensemble techniques that involve the use of statistical and machine trained models were used. Mathematical adjustments conducted were on the GLM as the baseline model. This was done on special considerations of precision versus accuracy for a much more error free pricing calculator. The pricing model that defines the price of tax risk of South African construction firms was developed. The study highlighted the key determinants of the price of tax risk for construction firms. Modeling techniques used to build the pricing model were discussed in detail. These techniques came from families of statistical and Machine Learning (ML) models. Challenges encountered in the research process were also highlighted and discussed in detail. The role of the South African Revenue Services (SARS) in making studies of this nature simpler to carry out was also made clear.

To achieve this, various classifiers were evaluated to identify the most effective method for the binary classification of the imbalanced dataset resulting from these checks. The results showed that XGBoost provided the best performance. Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization was utilized to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, with the goal of maximizing the F! score. Subsequently, threshold adjustment for the rejection class was applied to enhance the applicability of this approach in real-world scenarios. This adjustment aimed to minimize the number of entities classified into the rejection class - specifically, those instances with probabilities near the decision boundary.

We use a novel machine learning methodology to measure the corporate culture of a firm. Our results show that firms with stronger corporate culture are more likely to have material operations in tax haven countries and the extent of such operations is greater in these firms. The findings also suggest that firms with stronger corporate cultures engage in greater tax avoidance. Our results are robust to the use of both instrumental variables and difference-in-difference identification strategies. Finally, we show that having tax haven operations as a result of stronger corporate culture increases a firm's after-tax earnings in future periods. © 2024",Artificial intelligence; Corporate culture; Machine learning; Tax avoidance; Tax haven,,,Elsevier Inc.,10575219,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85208667980

The authors find that tax policies of different description vary systematically in their popularity with voters. In particular, official textual summaries of tax policy differ along two social dimensions that are associated with voters’ willingness to approve the tax. The authors interpret these dimensions as risk pooling and community orientation and show that measuring these dimensions can modestly improve the ability to predict the popularity of a tax, relative to a conventional regression specification that omits information about qualitative policy design.

The machine learning models employed automated features selection with hybrid two metaheuristics algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Dealing with a real dataset on the tax avoidance cases among companies in Malaysia, has created a stumbling block for the conventional machine learning models to achieve higher accuracy in the detection process as the associations among all of the features in the datasets are extremely low. This paper presents a hybrid meta-heuristic between PSO and adaptive GA operators for the optimization of features selection in the machine learning models. The hybrid PSO-GA has been designed to employ three adaptive GA operators hence three groups of features selection will be generated. The three groups of features selection were used in random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The results showed that most models that used PSO-GA hybrids have achieved better accuracy than the conventional approach (using all features from the dataset).

Accompanying these advances, newer geospatial approaches and machine learning algorithms have opened up new horizons for price prediction and mass appraisal assessment. The application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) within mass appraisal has generated considerable debate; these methods are often perceived as impractical because their explainability and defensibility-required for assessment application, notably in challenge scenarios-are limited. This study compares a traditional multiple regression analysis (MRA) approach with regularized (penalized) machine learning approaches and a more nuanced geostatistical technique, the eigenvector spatial filter (ESF) approach, applying data sets for two urban residential areas in the United Kingdom and the United States. The findings show the efficacy of the geostatistical ESF technique against the ML approaches-both of which outperform the traditional MRA. The findings also show the ESF approach provides the basis of a more understandable alternative spatial method for mass appraisal aligned with the MRA approach, with the spatial filters easily incorporated as predictors into MRA to alleviate spatial autocorrelation. Further, the penalized ML regression approaches offer a more practical alternative to other forms of ML for assessors. Both methods produce reliable yet understandable regression models for mass appraisal assessment. © 2022 International Association of Assessing Officers.

Delaying the filing of returns by taxpayers is the most primitive form of tax evasion. Taxpayers who delay the filing of returns are called return defaulters. It is the most brazen form of tax evasion. To tackle this problem, we introduce an example-dependent cost-sensitive deep learning model to identify potential return defaulters. This model takes example-dependent costs into account and makes predictions that aim to minimize the overall cost instead of minimizing the total number of misclassifications.

The researcher aims to discover and model behavior, through text analysis of data collected from a wide range of sources using interviews, surveys, blog and forum postings, published reports as well as personal communications, to demonstrate and inform using the pattern matching method initially proposed by Trochim (1989). Text mining and modeling techniques, using unsupervised machine learning facilitate large-scale analysis, and have been widely deployed in a range of language-based studies, driven by human-machine interaction. Major multinational corporations are excluded, and the study focuses on individuals and the smaller-scale juristic persons such as small and medium enterprises (SME). Behavioral approaches to taxation will motivate a better understanding of the phenomenon tax avoidance and tax evasion, once quantitative modeled. Overseas Americans are taxable, no matter where they reside globally, on the basis of having American citizenship. Non-citizens with a USA connection may also be subject to US taxes. The range of US taxable entities operating overseas include corporations, individuals, estates and trusts, and many of the small businesses filing as flow-through entities under the individual code, namely S-corporations, sole proprietorships, and partnerships, will be included in the study. There are an estimated 9 million taxable overseas Americans corporations and business entities. The Congressional Research Service (Gravelle, 2015), reported that as many as 100 billion U.S. dollars may go uncollected, due to tax evasion and a similar tax shortfall figure of 100 billion dollars is due to tax avoidance. Avoidance tends to be attributed to U.S. origin, multinational corporations and evasion by the smaller entities. The tax collection is exacerbated by changes to the 2018 tax code, which encourages compliance through tax cuts to a fixed 21% rate for the corporate sector, and reduced taxes for individual, opening up new avenues for aggressive tax avoidance strategies. A gap in the literature is the uncertainty regarding changing of the U.S. tax code in 2018 and how it will affect overseas American tax entities. © 2015-2017 Academic Research Publishing Group.",Avoidance; Evasion; FATCA; FBAR; GILTI; Tax; Text mining; Unsupervised machine learning,,,Academic Research Publishing Group,24136670,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068100638

We face a nonstandard applied machine learning scenario. First, one-sided labels: firms that are not caught as bogus are of unknown class: bogus or legitimate, and we need to not only use them to train the classifier but also make predictions on them. Second, multiple time-periods: each firm files several periodic VAT returns but its class is fixed so prediction needs to be made at the firm, not firm-period, level. Third, point in time simulation: we estimate the revenue saving potential of our model by simulating the implementation of our system in the past. We do this by rolling back the data to the state of knowledge at a specific time and calculating the revenue impact of acting on our model’s recommendations and catching the bogus firms, and estimate US$40 million in recovered revenue. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In Morocco, in particular, the tax on unbuilt urban land accounts for 35% of the revenue from taxes managed directly by the municipality. The property tax assessment system currently adopted is not regularly updated and is not properly monitored. These difficulties do not allow for a significant expansion of the land base. The current efforts aim at accelerating the census of the urban heritage using innovative and automated approaches which are intended to lead to the next generation of urban information services and the development of smart cities. In this context we propose a methodology that consists of acquisition of high-resolution UAV images.

With the development of commercial businesses, traditional algorithms are not appropriate for solving the tax evasion detection problem. Hence, other algorithms with acceptable speed, precision, analysis, and data decisions must be used. In the case of assets and tax assessment, the integration of machine learning models with meta-heuristic algorithms increases accuracy due to optimal parameters. In this paper, intelligent machine learning algorithms are used to solve tax evasion detection. This research uses an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm to improve the multilayer perceptron neural network by finding the optimal weight and improving support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with optimal parameters. The IPSO-MLP and IPSO-SVM models using the IPSO algorithm are used as new models for tax evasion detection. Our proposed system applies the dataset collected from the general administration of tax affairs of West Azerbaijan province of Iran with 1500 samples for the tax evasion detection problem. The evaluations show that the IPSO-MLP model has a higher accuracy rate than the IPSO-SVM model and logistic regression. Moreover, the IPSO-MLP model has higher accuracy than SVM, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, C5.0 decision tree, and AdaBoost. The accuracy of IPSO-MLP and IPSO-SVM models is 93.68% and 92.24%, respectively.  © 2022 Houri Mojahedi et al.",,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; Heuristic algorithms; Multilayer neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Parameter estimation; Support vector machines; Taxation; Detection problems; High-accuracy; Improved particle swarm optimization algorithms; Machine learning algorithms; MLP model; Optimal parameter; Particle swarm; Support vector machine models; Swarm optimization; Tax evasions; Particle swarm optimization (PSO),,Hindawi Limited,1024123X,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138447196

Tax evasion has had a severe detrimental influence on the economy of the Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. The Amhara Regional State lost tax revenue in recent years due to tax evasion. The objective of this study was to see how tax evasion, taxpayers’ psychological egoism, and other relevant factors affect tax revenue collection performance in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 395 VAT-registered taxpayers through a structured questionnaire. The structural equation model and multiple regression analysis method were utilized for empirical test based on the softwares of SPSS and AMOS. This research revealed that tax evasion and psychological egoism negatively affect tax revenue collection performance. Tax education and technology significantly and positively affected tax revenue collection performance. Meanwhile, the relationships between the above factors (tax evasion, tax education, and technology) and the tax revenue collection performance are reliably mediated by taxpayers’ psychological egoism. Those findings can give clues to researchers, tax experts, and policymakers for improving the tax revenue collection performance in Amhara Region. The government can enhance public education to reduce tax evasion and such misbehavior caused by taxpayers’ psychological egoism. Meanwhile, the most up-to-date tax invoicing technologies, like artificial intelligence and machine learning technology should be adopted.

This paper aims to predict features of tax fraud using the most robust supervised machine-learning model. This research provides a context where a fraud expert can use a machine-learning model, and an implemented model offers instant feedback to the fraud expert. We evaluate supervised machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, GaussianNB and XGBoost. Based on different evaluation metrics, Artificial Neural Network was the most robust model for predicting tax fraud. Findings reveal that the time of business that indicates the difference in time from when a business started and the time it was audited, the domestic businesses, taxpayers who import and export goods, those with no losses, those whose businesses are located in the eastern province, and those registered on withholding and Value Added Tax types are more susceptible to tax fraud. This study is among the few to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple supervised machine-learning models for identifying tax fraud factors on an accurate data set with numerous tax types.

Data mining, machine learning, and other approaches such as traditional random auditing have been used in many studies to deal with tax fraud. The goal of this study is to use Artificial Neural Networks to identify factors of tax fraud in income tax data. The results show that Artificial Neural Networks perform well in identifying tax fraud with an accuracy of 92%, a precision of 85%, a recall score of 99%, and an AUC-ROC of 95%. All businesses, either cross-border or domestic, the period of the business, small businesses, and corporate businesses, are among the factors identified by the model to be more relevant to income tax fraud detection. This study is consistent with the previous closely related work in terms of features related to tax fraud where it covered all tax types together using different machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use Artificial Neural Networks to detect income tax fraud in Rwanda by comparing different parameters such as layers, batch size, and epochs and choosing the optimal ones that give better accuracy than others. For this study, a simple model with no hidden layers, softsign activation function performs better. The evidence from this study will help auditors in understanding the factors that contribute to income tax fraud which will reduce the audit time and cost, as well as recover money foregone in income tax fraud. © 2022 by the authors.

This can help tax authorities to better allocate resources and identify potential cases of tax fraud or evasion. It is very challenging to build an identification model in the area of taxes due to a large amount of unlabelled tax data, the cost of data annotation in a single place, and the differences in attribute distributions between regions. This research focuses on developing popular ML-based algorithms called Transfer Adoptive Boosting (TAB) for tax fault detection. This algorithm is especially useful for predicting tax compliance outcomes, as it can be used to identify the most important factors in predicting tax compliance. TAB can be used to create a tax management and prediction system that is optimized to accurately predict tax compliance outcomes. By using a combination of weak learners such as decision trees, logistic regression, or neural networks, the TAB algorithm can be used to create a highly accurate tax management and prediction system. The model can also be used to identify which factors are most important for predicting tax compliance, allowing for more efficient tax management. By using TAB, tax managers and policymakers can more accurately predict the outcomes of tax compliance, leading to more efficient and effective tax management. © 2023 IEEE.",Machine Learning; Supervised Learning; Tax Data; Tax Default Prediction; Transfer Adoptive Boosting,Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; E-learning; Fault detection; Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Boosting algorithm; Digital age; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Management systems; Prediction systems; Tax data; Tax default prediction; Tax managements; Transfer adoptive boosting; Taxation,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,979-835039849-6,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163516321

In order to operate efficiently, the system incorporated in this design is constructed using a variety of Python programming language modules. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8), EasyOCR, OpenCV, and Selenium are the primary Python modules utilized; additional modules include RegEx (Regular Expression), Time, Numpy, and BytesIO. In this application, number plates are searched for and detected using the dilation method so that EasyOCR can extract every character with minimal error. Additionally, machine learning serves as the foundation for each of the aforementioned procedures and processes. The fundamental computation of machine learning from bespoke data sets is performed in Google Colab. The outcome of this investigation is a system capable of furnishing information pertaining to motor vehicle systems to an individual who has failed to remit vehicle tax.

Our experiments demonstrate emerging legal understanding capabilities, with improved performance in each subsequent OpenAI model release. We experiment with retrieving and using the relevant legal authority to assess the impact of providing additional legal context to LLMs. Few-shot prompting, presenting examples of question-answer pairs, is also found to significantly enhance the performance of the most advanced model, GPT-4. The findings indicate that LLMs, particularly when combined with prompting enhancements and the correct legal texts, can perform at high levels of accuracy but not yet at expert tax lawyer levels.

From social and economic viewpoints, this is an undesirable result since high inequality diminishes liquidity and trade. Besides, with very few exceptions, most agents end up with zero wealth, despite the inclusion of rational behaviour. To deal with this situation, here we include a taxation–redistribution mechanism in the ML algorithm. Previous results show that simple regulations can considerably reduce inequality if agents do not change their behaviour. However, when considering rational agents, different types of redistribution favour risk-averse agents, to some extent. Even so, we find that rational agents looking for optimal wealth can always arrive to an optimal risk, compatible with a particular choice of parameters, but increasing inequality.

Deterrence theory suggests improved audit effectiveness will increase compliance but excludes elements of tax morale, including perceived fairness. We find evidence supporting a moderated mediation model where procedural fairness mediates the relationship between audit procedures and tax compliance, moderated by participatory monitoring, which captures how effects vary when taxpayers willingly increase traceability of their income by advertising online. When taxpayers advertise business online, use of advanced technologies in audit selection significantly increases compliance with no significant effect on perceived fairness; when they do not, use of advanced technologies has no effect on compliance, but significantly decreases perceived fairness. © 2022, American Accounting Association.

Example in Malaysia the sources are direct tax, indirect tax and non-tax revenue. The federal government will then use the revenue for operations and developments in the country. There are currently limited methods to predict federal government revenue for upcoming years. Having different and better method can help to better plan the collection activities and managing the resources. For now, Malaysia federal government can only forecast or estimate the revenue. Business intelligence on the other hand is currently booming in the business world as it helps to improve and provides relevant information for decision making process.

In today’s practices, assessment-based property tax increases unmatched expenses in bubble economies. There is a substitution problem in rapid falls, the tendency to not decrease the assessments gives way to black holes and opens the door to ghost cities. This paper proposes alternative approaches, aside from market/land value or last sold price, aimed at improving sustainability and fairness rates. The dataset examined is based on 93.7K records and 88 attributes for assessed value of properties within the City of Buffalo, the United States of America. Since the label (Total Value) is a numerical and continuous value, regression models are selected, where ensemble machine learning methods categorically work well with larger datasets, combined with weak learners, like decision trees. Stacked Ensemble led the least error for regression with 0.98 R2, followed by Gradient Boosting. Results show a 79% domi-nance of uncontrollable attributes, such as Land Value, Neighborhood, and Sale (last sold) Price, compared to controllable attributes, such as Total Living Area, Construction Grade, Second Story Area, and many others.

In this regard, the international and EU policies toward collecting and exchanging a large amount of personal tax and financial data to facilitate innovation and to promote transparency in the financial and tax domain have been increased substantially over the last years. However, this vast collection and utilization of “big” tax and financial data raise also considerations around privacy and data protection, especially when these data are fed to clever algorithms to build detailed personal profiles or to take automated decisions which may exceptionally affect people's lives. Ultimately, these practices of profiling tax and financial behaviour provide fertile ground for discriminating processing of individuals and groups. In light of the above, this paper aims to shed light on the following four interdependent and highly disputed areas: firstly, to review the most well-known profiling and automated decision risks emerged from big data technology and machine learning algorithmic processing as well as to analyse their impact on the tax and financial privacy rights through their immense profiling practices; secondly, to document the current EU initiatives toward financial and tax transparency, namely the AEOI, PSD2, MiFID2, and data retention policies, along with their implications for personal data protection when used for profiling and automated decision purposes; thirdly, to highlight the way forward for mitigating the risks of profiling and automated decision in the big data era and to investigate the protection of individuals against these practices in the light of the new technical and legal frameworks; in this respect, we finally delve into the regulatory EU efforts towards fairer and accountable profiling and automated decision processes, and in particular we examine the extent to which the GDPR provisions establishes a protection regime for individuals against advanced profiling techniques, enabling thus accountability and transparency. © 2019 Eugenia Politou, Efthimios Alepis, Constantinos Patsakis",,Automation; Big data; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Taxation; Transparency; Data retention; Data technologies; Decision process; Financial data; Financial service; Legal frameworks; Personal profile; Privacy rights; Data privacy,,Elsevier Ltd,2673649,,CLSRE,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062942333

It is closely related to an organization's compliance with tax regulations, known as the taxpayers risk profile. However, this mechanism does not accurately detect tax avoidance and tax evasion risks. To overcome this limitation, we use a multilabel classification machine learning method in this study, which classifies a single observation into one or more labels at once. The approach involves problem transformation (binary relevance and label powerset), algorithm adaptation (multilabel k-nearest neighbor (ML-kNN) and multilabel-adaptive resonance associative map (ML-ARAM)), and ensemble (label space partitioning and random k-label sets with disjoint (RAkELd)). Based on the model performance comparisons, we discovered that the ML-ARAM method based on deep learning is the best, with an average F1-score of 95.5% and a hamming loss of 7.4%. We also examine the feature importance of the best model to reduce the dimensions of features so that we can identify the dominant factors that encourage a taxpayer entity to engage in tax avoidance or tax evasion.

The present study investigates whether lay people's conceptions about taxation reflect such a synergistic (vs. an antagonistic) climate. Applying an unsupervised machine learning approach (i.e., topic modeling) to over a million tax related tweets from 2010 to 2020, we identified 30 topics with different content. Using the theoretical framework differentiating between synergistic and antagonistic tax climate, we were able to further categorize these topics into four broader groups: 1. Opinions about Tax Politics, 2. Enforcement (antagonistic climate), 3. Information & Service (synergistic climate), and 4. Emotions. The most frequently observed group was Information & Service (synergistic climate), which also steadily gained prominence during the past decade. We proceeded by analyzing the information diffusion properties and sentiment of the tweets associated with the four groups. Information & Service tweets had the most positive sentiment but were shared the least, while tweets regarding Opinions about Tax Politics were shared most often. In sum, the results suggest that lay people's conceptions about taxation – as discerned from conversations on social media (Twitter) – largely reflect a synergistic (vs. an antagonistic) climate, and contribute to the literature on tax climate and social media. © 2023 The Author(s)",Information diffusion; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Taxation; Topic modeling,,,Elsevier B.V.,1672681,,JEBOD,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165106245

According to the characteristics of the fiscal and taxation domain, a hierarchical entity type set is defined, and a training corpus is obtained by using remote monitoring. Then a deep neural network model based on combined character features and word features is used for entity boundary recognition. Entity type tagging is taken as a multi-label and multi-type classification task, and on this basis a method based on ensemble learning is proposed for entity type tagging.

We find that flexible models, such as classification trees and ensemble methods based on them, outperform penalized linear models such as Lasso and ridge regression in predicting taxpayers more likely to increase their declarations after an audit. We show that despite the non-randomness of audits, their specific time structure and the distribution of changes in declared amounts suggest a causal interpretation of our results; that is, our approach detects a heterogeneity in the reaction to a tax audit, rather than just forecasting an unconditional future increase.

Such actions cause unusual volatilities in the amounts envisaged in the government budgeting. The fiscal and financial transactions outside the scope of the precautionary bound and failure to achieve the expected revenues of the country. One of the most important types of tax risks is concealing the information on buying, selling and contracts that in case of being uncovered in the financial sector it leads to the issuance of amendments to taxpayers. But if it is uncovered in the due course, it leads to the non-fulfillment of tax collection and thus negative financial waves at the national level and ultimately leads to detrimental financial impact to the financial framework of states and countries. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze, design and implement a system to extract high risk taxpayers and provide a model to forecast the amount of tax assessment notification of the taxpayers for the coming years so that it would play the role of the assistance system for the tax experts to issue the assessment notifications with realistic amounts during the assessment and tax audit to prevent major errors in the tax assessment. To extract high risk taxpayers using the variance and the mean standard deviation the suspicious financial behavior is detected and then the previously supervised data that exist in the tax base as amendment forms are used to classify the taxpayers and also the job coefficient field is used and high risk occupations are identified and classified. One of the strongest and best practices in this field is the use of statistical and financial calculations in time domain. The main feature is the amount of taxable income based on which the purchasing, sales, revenue and profit can be calculated. By studying the volatilities and noise detection in the amounts paid by taxpayers during the past years and also creating linear regression analysis it has been possible to discover the risk levels and forecast of the tax assessment notification for the coming years. Also using this technique tax assessment notification error tolerance of the previous years is obtained. Finally the high risk taxpayer detection system known as HTS is provided with the best and quickest manner possible. © 2016 IEEE.",artificial neural networks; big data; Data mining; machine learning; task risk assessment; tax fraud detection,Big data; Budget control; Deep neural networks; Finance; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sales; Signal processing; Taxation; Time domain analysis; Assistance system; Design and implements; Financial sectors; Financial transactions; Fraud detection; High-risk occupations; Mean standard deviation; Task risk assessments; Data mining,Taheri H.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-150905820-4,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016567729

Value chains formed in the digital environment are increasingly falling out of government control, and digital platforms allow the building of relationships that are opaque for tax authorities. The digital market itself is becoming a factor that creates new value and possibilities. The sharing society is self-learning to reduce the tax base: business is getting rid of intermediaries, eliminating the regulator, and avoiding double taxation and taxation in general. This is happening against the backdrop of the chaotic development of the global financial system. The paper's idea is based on creating a decision-making system for predicting tax evasion events by forming a special information framework of potentially suspicious events, using methods of deep learning of neural networks, and cognitive modelling. The latter was enriched with non-formalizable cognitive semantics, which increases the transparency of tax events.

The limited collection of government income taxes has forced the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (IRBM) to develop a solution to improve the tax compliance of the digital economy sector so that its taxpayers may report voluntary income or take firm action. The ability to diagnose the taxpayer’s compliance will ensure the IRBM effectively collects the income tax and gives revenues to the country. However, it gives challenges in extracting necessary knowledge from a large amount of data, leading to the need for a predictive model to detect the taxpayers’ compliance level. This paper proposes the descriptive and predictive analytics models for predicting the digital economic income tax compliance in Malaysia. We conduct descriptive analytics to explore and extract a summary of data for initial understanding. Through a brief description of the descriptive model, the data distribution in a histogram shows that the information extracted can give a clear picture in influencing the results to classify digital economic tax compliance. In predictive modeling, single and ensemble approaches are employed to find the best model and important factors contributing to the incompliance of tax payment among the digital economic retailers. Based on the validation of training data with the presence of seven single classifier algorithms, three performance improvements have been established through ensemble classification, namely wrapper, boosting, and voting methods, and two techniques involving grid search and evolution parameters. The experimental results show that the ensemble method can improve the single classification model’s accuracy with the highest classification accuracy of 87.94% compared to the best single classification model.

This has been driven by rapid advances in the applications and accuracy of AI through increasingly complex algorithms and models; this, in turn, has spurred research into specialized hardware AI accelerators. Given the rapid pace of advances, it is easy to forget that they are often developed and evaluated in a vacuum without considering the full application environment.

The application is an AI-centric edge video analytics application built using popular open source infrastructure and machine learning (ML) tools. Despite using state-of-the-art AI and ML algorithms, the application relies heavily on pre-and post-processing code. As AI-centric applications benefit from the acceleration promised by accelerators, we find they impose stresses on the hardware and software infrastructure: storage and network bandwidth become major bottlenecks with increasing AI acceleration. By specializing for AI applications, we show that a purpose-built edge data center can be designed for the stresses of accelerated AI at 15% lower TCO than one derived from homogeneous servers and infrastructure.  © 2021 ACM.",AI tax; end-to-end AI application,Digital storage; Face recognition; Machine learning; Open source software; Application environment; Complex algorithms; End-to-end analysis; Hardware and software; Network bandwidth; Specialized hardware; State of the art; Video analytics; Application programs,,Association for Computing Machinery,7342071,,ACSYE,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109101254

One way to reduce training time and resources is to train with a carefully selected subset of the full dataset. Prior work uses the gradient signals obtained during a warm-up or “pretraining” phase over the full dataset, for determining the core subset; if the pre-training phase is too small, the gradients obtained are chaotic and unreliable. As a result, the pre-training phase itself incurs significant time/resource overhead, and prior work has not gone beyond hyperparameter search to reduce pre-training time. Our work explicitly aims to reduce this pre-training tax in gradient-based subset training. We develop a principled, scalable approach for pre-training in a distributed setup. Our approach is lightweight and minimizes communication between distributed worker nodes. It is the first to utilize the concept of model-soup based distributed training at initialization. The key idea is to minimally train an ensemble of models on small, disjointed subsets of the data; we further employ data-driven sparsity and data augmentation for local worker training to boost ensemble diversity. The centralized model, obtained at the end of pre-training by merging the per-worker models, is found to offer stabilized gradient signals to select subsets, on which the main model is further trained. We have validated the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet, using ResNet and WideResNet models. For example, our approach is shown to achieve 15.4× pre-training speedup and 2.8× end-to-end speedup on CIFAR10 and ResNet18 without loss of accuracy.

Using machine learning predictions on satellite imagery to identify mines allows us to overcome the challenge of measuring evasion.

Most tax administrations across the world face similar challenges in the collection process, the most common of which is the compliance. It is important therefore to be able to detect revenue leakages as much as possible in order to increase overall collection. In this research we reviewed the tax assessment process that attempts to detect revenue leakages due to under declarations, fraud and declaration errors. We developed a machine-learning model using supervised learning to detect declaration audit and assessment selections that are likely to lead to a significantly high revenue collection from these leakages. Due to the large volumes of audit cases generated by audit selection methods, some of which yield very little collections after the audits, it was important to intelligently separate cases that are likely lead to smaller insignificant revenue collection from the cases that yield significant revenue against in comparison with resources used to perform audits and assessments. The test results from the model we created produced positive results with an accuracy of 83%. The results showed that the model would help the revenue authority effectively increase revenue collections with the same amount of resources. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Assessment; Audit; Compliance; Machine Learning; Tax,Data mining; Economics; Machine learning; Assessment; Audit; Collection process; Compliance; Economic growths; Integral part; Machine-learning; Prediction modelling; Revenue leakage; Tax assessment; Taxation,Silhavy R.; Silhavy P.,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23673370,978-303135313-0,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172732864

Unsupervised learning approach is the dominant framework due to the lack of label and ground truth in corresponding datasets, although these methods suffer from lower interpretability and precision compared with supervised approaches. In contrast to prior research works, we examine the possibility of a hybrid unsupervised method for tax evasion risk management that is able to internally validate and explain outliers detected in a given tax dataset. The proposed method, HUNOD (Hybrid UNsupervised Outlier Detection),1 combines clustering and representation learning for robust outlier detection, additionally allowing its users to incorporate relevant domain knowledge into both constituent outlier detection approaches in order to identify outliers relevant for a given economic context. The interpretability of obtained outliers is achieved by training explainable-by-design surrogate models over internally validated outliers. The experimental evaluation of the HUNOD method is conducted on two datasets derived from the database on individual personal income tax declarations collected by the Tax Administration of Serbia.

The submission of false tax reports, such as declaring earnings that are undervalued. In other words, tax fraud is the lying on a tax return form to reduce tax liability. Therefore, detecting tax fraud is one of the main priorities of the tax authorities. Most of the recent works and modern business in tax fraud detection in many countries around the world rely on machine learning techniques that make use of labelled data. unsupervised learning has main advantage, that enabled this techniques e to deal with problems like detecting Tax Froud, which can be considered as a challenge in terms of decision.Also supervised learning is capable of classify the data. Therefore, this research paper aims to detect tax fraud and determine its level by building an optimal machine learning model by a new hybrid neural network technique that depend on two type of learning unsupervised learning and supervised learning for detecting tax fraud and determine its level.

Accurate predictions of customs revenues result in better liquidity of the central budget, and for that reason, they are extremely important for successful management of public finances. The orthodox approach to forecasting revenues is usually based on forecasting revenues based on tax buoyancy and tax elasticity, with respect of some economic proxy. However, this approach has some shortcomings which can negatively affect accuracy, and for that reason we examine different approaches (machine learning and ensembling). Namely, nowadays in the era of Big Data and digitisation in customs, new approaches based on computer algorithms can give us better results as compared to classic modelling. The paper concludes that using ensemble methods that combine different types of heterogeneous models such as statistical modelling and machine learning can improve forecast accuracy when predicting customs revenues. © 2021, International Network of Customs Universities.

Associated with customs transactions is customs fraud-the intentional manipulation of goods declarations to avoid taxes and duties. Due to limited manpower, the customs offices can only manually inspect a small number of declarations, necessitating the automation of customs fraud detection by machine learning (ML) techniques. The limited availability of manually inspected ground truth data makes it essential for the ML approach to generalize well on unseen data. However, current customs fraud detection models are not well suited or designed for this setting. In this work, we propose GraphFC (Graph neural networks for Customs Fraud), a model-agnostic, domain-specific, graph neural network based customs fraud detection model that is designed to work in a real-world setting with limited ground truth data. Extensive experimentation using real customs data from two countries demonstrates that GraphFC generalizes well over unseen data and outperforms various baselines and other models by a large margin. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

One target of such interventions is reckless behavior, such as texting while driving, which in most cases is harmless but sometimes leads to catastrophic outcomes. Past research has demonstrated how interventions can backfire when the tax on one reckless behavior is set too high whereas other less attractive reckless actions remain untaxed. In the context of experience-based decisions, this undesirable outcome arises from people behaving as if they underweighted rare events, which according to a popular theoretical account can result from basing decisions on a small, random sample of past experiences. Here, we reevaluate the adverse effect of overtaxation using an alternative account focused on recency. We show that a reinforcement-learning model that weights recently observed outcomes more strongly than than those observed in the past can provide an equally good account of people’s behavior. Furthermore, we show that there exist two groups of individuals who show qualitatively distinct patterns of behavior in response to the experience of catastrophic outcomes. We conclude that targeted interventions tailored for a small group of myopic individuals who disregard catastrophic outcomes soon after they have been experienced can be nearly as effective as an omnibus intervention based on taxation that affects everyone. © 2021, Society for Judgment and Decision making.

However, high cost has hindered its commercial diffusion, resulting in the dependence on financial policy support. With the phasing out of purchase subsidies, new policy mixes should be proposed. Therefore, a modified generalized Bass model based on technology learning is established to investigate the comprehensive effects of various policy mixes on the HD-FCETs diffusion including tractor-trailers, dump trucks, and straight trucks. About 113 policy mix scenarios - consisting of one or more policy tools from sales ban policy, hydrogen subsidy, and purchase tax - are simulated. The obtained results reveal that: (i) All policy mix scenarios can increase the ownership amount of HD-FCETs by 1.92%–35.7% by 2060 compared with no policy scenario; (ii) The most efficient policy mix scenario can reduce the cumulative social costs from 323.69 billion CNY to 210.3 billion CNY, while inappropriate policies and no technological advances could increase the cumulative social costs to 356.6 billion CNY and 732.6 billion CNY respectively; (iii) Among these policy tools, the sale ban policy is indispensable, moreover, both the HD-FCET classes and the policy intensity can affect the optimal policy mix choice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",HD-FCETs; Market diffusion; Technology learning; The modified generalized bass model; The total cost of ownership,China; Automobiles; Costs; Diffusion; Engineering education; Fuel cells; Learning systems; Sales; Tractors (truck); Truck transportation; Comprehensive effect; Electric truck; Generalized bass models; Hydrogen fuel cell electric truck; Hydrogen fuel cells; Market diffusion; Technology learning; The modified generalized bass model; The total cost of ownership; alternative energy; diffusion; electric vehicle; energy market; energy policy; fuel cell; hydrogen; machine learning; trucking; Hydrogen,,Elsevier Ltd,3014215,,ENPYA,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180537884

Practically, the GST time series datasets exhibit linear and non-linear fluctuations due to the dynamic economic environment, changes in tax rates and tax base, and tax non-compliance, posing challenges for accurate forecasting. Traditional time-series forecasting methods like ARIMA, assuming linearity, often yield inaccurate results. To address this, we explore alternative forecasting models, including Trigonometric Seasonality Box-Cox Transformation ARIMA errors Trend Seasonal components (TBATS) and Neural Networks: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Neural Networks for Autoregression (NNAR), which capture both linear and non-linear relationships. First, we test single time series models like Exponential Smoothing (ETS), TBATS, ANN, and NNAR. Second, we also test hybrid models combining linear models, non-linear models, and neural network models. The findings reveal that the Hybrid Theta-TBATS model offers superior forecasting accuracy, challenging recent research favouring neural network models. The study highlights the effectiveness of advanced non-linear models, particularly TBATS and its hybridisations with linear models, in GST revenue forecasting. Our study also found that the single TBATS is the second-best model, which offers better forecasting accuracy. These insights have significant implications for policymakers and researchers in taxation and fiscal planning, emphasising the need to incorporate non-linear dynamics and advanced modelling techniques to enhance the accuracy of GST revenue forecasts. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, retrieving a dataset, especially a tax return dataset, is challenging as privacy becomes more evident in our daily lives. Thus, data synthesis is an approach selected for our work by utilizing publicly available data and augmenting it using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE). The evaluation is performed using a Correlation Matrix, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Quality Score. In addition, fundamental machine learning models are utilized to detect tax evasion based on a literature review. The data are gathered from the financial statements of companies registered within the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). Our results indicate that synthetic datasets with 0.87 average Quality Score can train models that yield approximately 0.95 Accuracy and 0.91 F1-Score. Additionally, by increasing more instances, the effect of class imbalance and high variance can be mitigated. The expected benefits include the use of open data for analysis and application of synthetic datasets. Forthcoming research could consider the statistical behavior of different business sectors, multiclass labeling for advanced recommendations, and implementation of unsupervised models.  © 2013 IEEE.",financial statement; GAN; SMOTE; Synthetic dataset; tax evasion,Behavioral research; Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Principal component analysis; Quality control; Taxation; Behavioral science; Financial statements; Government; Machine-learning; Regulation; Risks management; Synthetic datasets; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Tax evasions; Tax returns; Risk management,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160271058

This paper summarizes our research on training a machine learning classifier to determine likelihood ratios and thus predict the outcome of a restricted set of cases from Germany’s jurisdiction. Based on a data set of German tax law cases (44 285 documents from 1945 to 2016) we selected those cases which belong to an appeal decision (5 990 documents). We used the provided meta-data and natural language processing to extract 11 relevant features and trained a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether an appeal is going to be successful or not. The evaluation (10-fold cross validation) on the data set has shown a performance regarding (formula presented) -score between 0.53 and 0.58. This score indicates that there is room for improvement.

Third, recent methods cannot adapt to a dynamic transaction network. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel tax evasion detection method, the temporal edge enhanced graph attention network (T-EGAT), which combines the edge enhanced graph attention network (EGAT) and the recurrent weighted average unit (RWA). Specifically, the EGAT is used to learn complex topological structures for capturing spatial dependence and the RWA is used to learn the dynamic changes of transaction data for capturing temporal dependence. Experimental tests using real-world tax data demonstrate that our method achieves better performance at detecting tax evaders than existing methods. © 2020 IEEE.",attention mechanism; dynamic transaction network; graph neural network; tax evasion detection,Big data; Recurrent neural networks; Detection methods; Expert experience; Machine learning technology; Recent researches; Spatial dependence; Temporal dependence; Topological structure; Weighted averages; Taxation,Wu X.; Jermaine C.; Xiong L.; Hu X.T.; Kotevska O.; Lu S.; Xu W.; Aluru S.; Zhai C.; Al-Masri E.; Chen Z.; Saltz J.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172816251-5,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103850668

Ave, Cambridge, 02139, MA, United States","The U.S. tax gap is estimated to exceed $450 billion, most of which arises from non-compliance on the part of individual taxpayers (GAO 2012; IRS 2006). Much is hidden in innovative tax shelters combining multiple business structures such as partnerships, trusts, and S-corporations into complex transaction networks designed to reduce and obscure the true tax liabilities of their individual shareholders. One known gambit employed by these shelters is to offset real gains in one part of a portfolio by creating artificial capital losses elsewhere through the mechanism of “inflated basis” (TaxAnalysts 2005), a process made easier by the relatively flexible set of rules surrounding “pass-through” entities such as partnerships (IRS 2009). The ability to anticipate the likely forms of emerging evasion schemes would help auditors develop more efficient methods of reducing the tax gap. To this end, we have developed a prototype evolutionary algorithm designed to generate potential schemes of the inflated basis type described above. The algorithm takes as inputs a collection of asset types and tax entities, together with a rule-set governing asset exchanges between these entities. The schemes produced by the algorithm consist of sequences of transactions within an ownership network of tax entities. Schemes are ranked according to a “fitness function” (Goldberg in Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning. Addison-Wesley, Boston, 1989); the very best schemes are those that afford the highest reduction in tax liability while incurring the lowest expected penalty. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Agent-based modeling; Genetic algorithms; Tax evasion,,,Springer Verlag,14356104,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939943465

With the advancements in data mining technology, many machine learning techniques have yielded results in identifying tax evasion. However, to realize satisfactory performance, these models require large amounts of human annotated data. In the tax field, unlabeled tax data are abundant, data annotation in a single region is expensive, and the distributions of characteristics differ among regions; these factors pose substantial difficulties in the development of an identification model. Existing tax evasion detection methods are either trained for single-region tasks, in which case they perform poorly on inter-region tax evasion identification due to the discrepancies in feature distributions, or utilize labeled data from both the target-task field and different but related auxiliary fields to reuse and transfer knowledge of the target domain data, in which case they cannot deal with scenarios in which there are no labeled data in target audit tasks. Although current unsupervised transfer learning techniques can train models in labeled regions for unlabeled regions, large intra-class distribution discrepancies cannot be perfectly minimized in tax evasion detection scenarios. To better address the above challenges, this paper proposes a general architecture, namely, the unsupervised conditional adversarial networks (UCAN) for tax evasion detection, which is the first approach to solve audit tasks in unlabeled target domains via inter-region transfer. Our architecture establishes an adversarial neural network adding label information in the distribution adapter, which can granularly adapt the joint probability distribution (JPD) of the data. We introduce a constraint that is based on the conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) of the extracted features to align the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the deep representation. Our model is formed by combining the distribution adapter and the label predictor to realize end-to-end learning of unsupervised feature transfer. The experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model in all migration tasks compared with state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",Adversarial Networks; Distribution Adaptation; Tax Evasion Detection; Unsupervised Transductive Transfer Learning,Big data; Data mining; Labeled data; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Probability distributions; Taxation; Adversarial networks; Conditional probability distributions; Distribution Adaptation; Joint probability distributions; Machine learning techniques; Tax collection and managements; Tax evasions; Unsupervised transfer learning; Transfer learning,Baru C.; Huan J.; Khan L.; Hu X.T.; Ak R.; Tian Y.; Barga R.; Zaniolo C.; Lee K.; Ye Y.F.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172810858-2,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081350644

To train an effective model to detect tax evaders, a large amount of data is required, especially sufficient labeled data. However, the expensive and time-consuming annotation process results in small amount of labeled data being available, which makes the development of detection models difficult. To address this issue, we propose a tax evasion detection method based on positive and unlabeled learning (TEDM-PU), to identify tax evasion by utilizing limited annotated tax evasion taxpayers and a large amount of unlabeled data. The TEDM-PU framework consists of three stages: a preprocessing stage extracting taxpayer features based on random forest, a pseudo labeling stage assigning pseudo labels to unlabeled samples based on PUAdapter, and a model training stage based on LightGBM method. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed TEDM-PU, we conduct experimental tests on real-world tax data. The results demonstrate that TEDM-PU method can detect tax evaders with higher accuracy and better interpretability than state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IEEE.",interpretability; PU learning; tax evasion detection,Big data; Decision trees; Labeled data; Random forests; Taxation; Detection methods; Experimental test; Interpretability; Positive and unlabeled learning; Pu learning; State-of-the-art methods; Tax evasions; Unlabeled samples; Learning systems,Baru C.; Huan J.; Khan L.; Hu X.T.; Ak R.; Tian Y.; Barga R.; Zaniolo C.; Lee K.; Ye Y.F.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172810858-2,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081293665

Firstly, the paper introduces the potential application of the random forest model in identifying tax risks. Subsequently, the experimental analysis focuses on the selection of indicators for tax risk. Finally, the paper develops and utilizes actual taxpayer data to test a risk identification model, confirming its effectiveness. The experimental results indicate that the model’s output report includes basic taxpayer information, a summary of tax compliance risks, value-added tax refund situations, directions of suspicious items, and detailed information on common indicators. This paper comprehensively presents detailed taxpayer data, providing an intuitive understanding of tax-related risks. Additionally, the paper reveals the level of enterprise risk registration assessment, risk probability, risk value, and risk assessment ranking. Further analysis shows that enterprise risk points primarily exist in operating income, selling expenses, financial expenses, and total profit. Additionally, the results indicate significant differences between the model’s judgment values and declared values, especially in the high-risk probability of total operating income and profit. This implies a significant underreporting issue concerning corporate income tax for real estate enterprises. Therefore, this paper contributes to enhancing the identification of tax risks for real estate enterprises. Using the optimized random forest model makes it possible to accurately assess enterprises’ tax compliance risks and identify specific risk points. © 2024 Xu, Kong.

One of the most common types of tax evasion is to lower the declared taxable amount. This kind of behavior will lead to the loss of tax revenues and damage the fairness of taxation. One of the main roles of the tax authorities is to conduct tax evasion testing through efficient auditing methods. At present, by using machine learning technology along with large amounts of labeled data, tax evasion detection models have achieved good results in specific areas. However, it is a long and costly process for tax experts to label large amounts of data. Since, the data distribution characteristics vary from region to region, models cannot be used across regions. In this paper, we propose a new method called a transferable tax evasion detection method based on positive and unlabeled learning (TTED-PU), which uses only semi-supervised techniques to detect tax evasion in the source domain. In addition, we use the idea of transfer to adapt to the domain to predict tax evasion behavior on the target domain where labeled tax data are unavailable. We evaluate our method on real-world tax data set. The experimental results show that our model can detect tax evasion in both the source and target domains. © 2020 IEEE.",positive and unlabeled learning; tax evasion; transfer learning,Application programs; Learning systems; Semi-supervised learning; Data distribution; Detection methods; Detection models; Large amounts of data; Machine learning technology; Positive and unlabeled learning; Semi-supervised; Tax authorities; Taxation,Chan W.K.; Claycomb B.; Takakura H.; Yang J.-J.; Teranishi Y.; Towey D.; Segura S.; Shahriar H.; Reisman S.; Ahamed S.I.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172817303-0,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094106817

Through the convenience of social media platforms as a means of communication, content sharing and even payment between different users, black market transactions are now enabled by e-commerce. Tax authorities worldwide have voiced their concern over the difficulty to detect such transactions over the internet. This paper presents a machine learning based Regtech tool for international tax authorities to detect transaction-based tax evasion activities across social e-commerce. To build such a tool, we collected a dataset of 58, 660 Instagram posts and manually labelled 2, 041 sampled posts with multiple properties related to transaction-based tax evasion activities. Based on the dataset, we developed a multimodal deep neural network to automatically detect suspicious posts. The proposed model combines comments, hashtags and image modalities (including extracted from videos) to produce the final output. As shown by our experiments, the complementary combined model achieved sensitivity of 71.9 %, specificity of 87.5%, accuracy of 84.1 % and AUC of 0.837, outperforming any single modality models. This tool could help tax authorities to identify audit targets in an efficient and effective manner, and combat social e-commerce tax evasion in scale. © 2021 IEEE.",Deep neural networks; Regtech; Social e-commerce; Social media; Tax administration,Electronic commerce; Social networking (online); Taxation; Communications content; Content Sharing; E- commerces; Multi-modal; Regtech; Social e-commerce; Social media; Social media platforms; Tax authorities; Tax evasions; Deep neural networks,Zhou J.; Salvado O.; Sohel F.; Borges P.V.K.; Wang S.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166541709-9,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124276401

The influence of various relationships among enterprises on tax arrears is not considered. This paper integrates multivariate data to construct an enterprise knowledge graph. Then, the correlations between different enterprises and risk events are selected as the prediction variables from the knowledge graph. Finally, a tax arrears prediction machine learning model is constructed and implemented with better prediction power than earlier studies. The results show that the correlations between enterprises and tax arrears events through the same telephone number, the same E-mail address and the same legal person commonly exist. Based on these correlations, potential tax arrears can be effectively predicted by the machine learning model.

The AI Economist is a two-level, deep RL framework for policy design in which agents and a social planner coadapt. In particular, the AI Economist uses structured curriculum learning to stabilize the challenging two-level, coadaptive learning problem. We validate this framework in the domain of taxation. In one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal tax policy of economic theory. In spatiotemporal economies, the AI Economist substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent tax-gaming strategies while accounting for emergent labor specialization, agent interactions, and behavioral change. These results demonstrate that two-level, deep RL complements economic theory and unlocks an AI-based approach to designing and understanding economic policy.

China's government attempts to use a variety of means, including tax instruments to control environmental pollution. After nine years of repeated debates, the State Council Legislative Affairs Office released the Environmental Protection Tax Law (Draft) in June 2015. As China's first environmental tax law, whether this conservative ""Environmental Fee to Tax (EFT)"" reform could improve the environment has generated controversy. In this paper, we seek insights to this controversial issue using the machine learning approach, a powerful tool for environmental policy assessment. We take Hubei Province, the first pilot area as a case of EFT, and analyze the institutional incentive, behavior transformation and emission intensity reduction performance. Twelve pilot cities located in Hubei Province were selected to estimate the effect of the reform by using synthetic control and a rapid developing machine learning method for policy evaluation. We find that the EFT reform can promote emission intensity reduction. Especially, relative to comparable synthetic cities in the absence of the reform, the average annual emission intensity of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in the pilot cities dropped by 0.13 ton/million Yuan with a reduction rate of 10%-32%. Our findings also show that the impact of environmental tax reform varies across cities due to the administrative level and economic development. The results of our study are also supported by enterprise interviews. The EFT improves the overall environmental costs, and encourages enterprises to reduce emissions pollution. These results provide valuable experience and policy implications for the implementation of China's Environmental Protection Tax Law.. © 2016 by the authors.",China; Environmental fee to tax reform; Machine learning; Sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions; Synthetic control method,China; Hubei; atmospheric pollution; economic development; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental protection; environmental tax; machine learning; policy analysis; policy implementation; sulfur dioxide; sustainable development; tax incentive; tax reform; urban area,,MDPI,20711050,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000715918

Many efforts have been made to develop tax evasion detection models by leveraging machine learning techniques, but they have not constructed a uniform model for different geographical regions because an ample supply of training examples is a fundamental prerequisite for an effective detection model. When sufficient tax data are not readily available, the development of a representative detection model is more difficult due to unequal feature distributions in different regions. Existing methods face a challenge in explaining and tracing derived results. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Inter-Region Tax Evasion Detection method based on Transfer Learning (IRTED-TL), which is optimized to simultaneously augment training data and induce interpretability into the detection model. We exploit evasion-related knowledge in one region and leverage transfer learning techniques to reinforce the tax evasion detection tasks of other regions in which training examples are lacking. We provide a unified framework that takes advantage of auxiliary data using a transfer learning mechanism and builds an interpretable classifier for inter-region tax evasion detection. Experimental tests based on real-world tax data demonstrate that the IRTED-TL can detect tax evaders with higher accuracy and better interpretability than existing methods. © 2018 IEEE.",inter-region detection; interpretability; tax evasion; transfer learning,Data privacy; Geographical regions; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Taxation; Experimental test; Feature distribution; Interpretability; Machine learning techniques; Region detection; Tax evasions; Transfer learning; Unified framework; Big data,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153864387-7,,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054088977

This study aims to provide an overview of the machine learning techniques used in this context and analyze their accuracy. We conducted a systematic mapping study to collect studies published in the last seven years that address machine learning methods in the mass appraisal of properties. The search protocols returned 332 studies, of which 22 were selected, highlighting the frequent use of Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models in the last three years. These models, especially Random Forest, have shown predictive superiority over traditional appraisal methods. The measurement of model performance varied among the studies, making it difficult to compare results. However, it was observed that the use of machine learning techniques improves accuracy in mass property appraisals.

Anonymized data collected by the Mexican federal government comprises more than 80 million contributors (individuals and companies) and almost 7 billion monthly-aggregations of invoices among contributors between January 2015 and December 2018. This data includes a list of almost ten thousand contributors already identified as tax evaders, due to their activities fabricating invoices for non-existing products or services so that recipients can evade taxes. Harnessing this extensive dataset, we build monthly and yearly temporal networks where nodes are contributors and directed links are invoices produced in a given time slice. Exploring the properties of the network neighborhoods around tax evaders, we show that their interaction patterns differ from those of the majority of contributors. In particular, invoicing loops between tax evaders and their clients are over-represented. With this insight, we use two machine-learning methods to classify other contributors as suspects of tax evasion: deep neural networks and random forests. We train each method with a portion of the tax evader list and test it with the rest, obtaining more than 0.9 accuracy with both methods. By using the complete dataset of contributors, each method classifies more than 100 thousand suspects of tax evasion, with more than 40 thousand suspects classified by both methods. We further reduce the number of suspects by focusing on those with a short network distance from known tax evaders. We thus obtain a list of highly suspicious contributors sorted by the amount of evaded tax, valuable information for the authorities to further investigate illegal tax activity in Mexico. With our methods, we estimate previously undetected tax evasion in the order of $10 billion USD per year by about 10 thousand contributors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,18600832,,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116110979
